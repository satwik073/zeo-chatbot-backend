Introduction
The mParticle platform is the hub for all of your data. It collects data from any number of inputs - mobile apps, web, feeds from external SAAS providers, data sent via our Events API - and forwards it on to output services to be used for analytics, attribution, storage, audience targeting, push notifications, etc.
The primary task accomplished in the mParticle dashboard is creating Connections between inputs and outputs - to collect your data, enrich and transform it, and forward it to where it needs to go. mParticle forwards two main types of data:
Accounts, organizations, and workspaces
mParticle creates a unique organization for you. Itâs the container for all data and metadata related to your mParticle. Within an organization, mParticle will create one or more accounts for you, and within each account, you can create one or more workspaces. Your choices for account and workspace setup are important because these choices affect identity and feature provisioning.

These three nested containers provide scoping and functionality for multi-brand and multi-geo use cases, as well as edge use cases. The scope and advantages of each are explained in the following sections.
Organization
Most mParticle customers have one organization which contains one or more accounts. However, some large companies have multiple organizations. No information is shared across organization boundaries. mParticle creates the organization(s) for you.
A few features apply at the organization level, includingprofile strategies.
You can think of the organization as representing your company.
Account
Each organization has one or more accounts. Accounts often represent different functional groups or goals within an organization, for example regional divisions, or Sales, Marketing, and Customer Support. mParticle creates the account(s) for you.
Some information is shared across accounts either by default or by enablement:
Workspace
Each account contains one or more workspaces. A workspace is the basic container for data in an mParticle account.  mParticle creates your first workspace, but you can add more at any time.
For most use cases, each workspace is its own domain, separate from other workspaces. Some information is shared across workspace boundaries:
Some mParticle accounts have over a dozen workspaces, while others have only one. How you organize data from your app ecosystem is entirely up to you.
Using organizations, accounts, and workspaces
Use organizations, accounts, and workspaces to manage multiple brands, regions, and to manage custom identity configurations and unique input/output requirements.  You can also use mParticle features likecross-account audience sharingormultiple workspace real-time audiences.
To see which accounts and organizations are available:
The Best Bags company sells handbags under several different names, and in several regions of the globe. They can use organizations and workspaces to provide differentiation when needed:
You can also useidentity scopeto manage how user data is shared between workspaces and accounts. And if you need to share audiences across accounts, you can request that mParticle enablecross-account audience sharingfor your organization.
Managing workspaces
Click on the name of your current workspace in the top-left corner of the dashboard to open the workspaces menu. From here you can switch into any of your current workspaces, or clickSettingsto open the Workspace Settings page.

From the Workspace Settings page, you can:
Note that you canât delete a workspace that is part of aMulti Workspace Audience. First delete or modify the multiworkspace audience, then you can delete the workspace.
Working with web data
mParticle handles Web data â collected from a browser client â a little differently from data collected from native apps.
In most cases, data collected by the mParticle SDK is sent to mParticle, and then forwarded on to integration partners server-to-server.
There are exceptions to this rule: in cases where a server-to-server integration cannot support all the required functionality of an integration partner, an Embedded Kit may be used. Embedded Kits are extra components added to the mParticle SDK that communicate directly with an integration partner from the app client.
While direct communication between the client and partner is the exception for native apps, it is common for web data. A key reason for this is that most of mParticleâs integration partners are not set up to receive web data server-to-server, as they rely on cookie data only accessible to the cookie owner. To support these integrations, the mParticle Web SDK uses the following workflow:
To make it easier to work with web integrations, we provide the source code in a public repository, so you can work with the Integration Partnerâs documentation and see exactly how we map mParticle methods onto the Partner code. See themparticle-integrations organizationfor a complete list of client-side web integrations.
Platform limits
mParticle imposes limits on the number and length of attributes that can be associated with events and users.
A quick summary of some of the most important limits is below. For more information, see our fullDefault Service Limitsguide.
Events
Users
Note that Output Services often have their own limits, which can differ from mParticleâs. When planning your implementation, check the documentation for your Output Services in theIntegration Centerto make sure you are complying with their limits.
Tracking protection
Browsers add third-party tracking protection for end users. The protections affect third-party trackers and their cookies and work in different ways. For example, Firefox Enhanced Tracking Protection (ETP) relies on a list of known trackers to decide what to block. Safari, Chrome for iOS and other browsers with the Apple WebKit engine use Intelligent Tracking Protection (ITP). ITP prevents the browser from loading cookies from a third-party domain.
mParticle aligns with this privacy stance.
User attributes and event attributes
mParticle ingests data points that are composed of event attributes and user attributes.
User attributes and input source priority
For a given user, attributes are stord at the workspace level, not the device level.
User attributes are ingested according to the following priority:
Once ingested from a particular source type, subsequent source types for that same data wonât be ingested. For example, once you set a user attribute key value using the Web SDK, you wonât be able to set that same value from a partner data feed.
Timestamps and ingested data
When mParticle ingests data, there are two timestamps associated with events:
If batches or events have a timestamp that is more than 15 minutes in the future, relative to the server processing the data, that timestamp will be reset to the current server UTC time. Attribute timestamps remain unchanged.
If you load data using CSV Import, the batch timestamp is reset to the current server UTC time.
Forward-looking statements
mParticle strives to be as transparent as possible. Part of this transparency is to share information about products, features, or functionality that we expect to deliver in the future.
Forward-looking statements are as accurate as possible given the knowledge at the time of publication. However, no purchasing decisions should be made on the basis of any forward-looking statement, and mParticle may withdraw or change the products, features, or functionality mentioned in such statements.
Next steps
To get started with mParticle, set up some data inputs and integrate with at least one output service. SeeWeb End-to-End Tutorialfor instructions on how to set up connections, and see your first data flow from input to output. If you arenât working with Web apps or services, visitGetting Startedfor more generic instructions.
Once youâre up and running, see the rest of this Platform guide for a more advanced look at the mParticle dashboard, or browseIntegrationsto see all available integrations.

CDP
account
Each customer has at least one mParticle account, which contains one or more workspaces. All accounts for the same customer are contained within an organization (org). These three logical containers control different types of scope. For example, The Profile API is set to workspace scope, while the Platform API is set to account scope.
act-as feed
A feed you can configure as if it comes from an iOS, Android, or Web platform (Act as Platformoption in the Feed Configuration). Data from the feed can be forwarded to any output that supports the specified platform type.
alias
Aliasing is a feature that allows clients to associate anonymous customer events to post-sign up events.  Functionally, aliasing performs a copy operation from a source MPID to target MPID. The source MPID is unchanged and still accessible in the system.
This feature is supported by the Profile Link and Profile Conversion identity strategies.
ARN
Amazon Resource Name. A complete ARN is required for partner lambda integrations and some Amazon Redshift integrations.
attribute
A key-value pair that provides additional information about an event, user, or product. For example, a custom event Play Video might have the attribute ofcategorywith a value ofdocumentary.
audience
A set of users connected to an integration for the purpose of engaging those users. Audiences may bereal-timeorstandard:
If the type of audience isnât specified, then the reference is likely toreal-timeaudiences unless stated otherwise.
audience real-time lookback window
A date range for how far back you can look to create real-time (not standard) audience segments, apply event enrichment of profiles, and to keep calculated attribute values up to date after initiatilization. Most lookback windows are 30, 60, or 90 days. Lookback windows are defined in the service agreement and are sometimes referred to as âhot storage.â
Contrast withdata retention.
AWS
Amazon Web Services. mParticle accounts are assigned to an AWS region that provides optimal performance.
batch
The basic processing unit for all mParticle data. A batch contains data about a single user of your app, on a maximum of one device. And includes an array of events along with information about the user and device. You can inspect raw batches in JSON format in the Live Stream and User Activity View.
Beta release
An early release of mParticle products or features. Seereleasesfor more details.
calculated attribute
A read-only user attribute with a value that is automatically calculated as new event data is received. Examples of calculated attributes include a total count of events, aggregation of events, the discrete occurrence of events, or lists of unique event attributes.
CDP
Customer data platform. mParticle includes functionality for CDP, as well as decision making powered by machine learning with Cortex, and behavioral analytics with Indicative.
certified partner
A company that isa certified solutions partner or technology partnerwith mParticle.
channel
The type of input by which a batch reached mParticle. Not to be confused with platform. For example, a batch for the Android platform can arrive via three different channels: the SDK, the server-to-server Event API, or an âact asâ partner feed.
client-side
Data forwarded directly from a device or web browser to an integration partner. Client-side integrations often require a kit to be included with the mParticle SDK. Some client-side kits have a configuration option to work in tandem with a server-side integration.
Contrast withserver-side.
cold storage
Seedata retention.
commerce events
A special mParticle event type that tracks actions related to products and promotions. Examples of commerce events are Add to Cart, Purchase and Refund.
configuration settings and connection settings
Settings for event and audience integrations are split into two sections: configuration settings and connection settings.
connection
A configuration that defines how data flows into mParticle (input) or is forwarded out of it (output).
consent
mParticle lets you track a userâs consent for their data to be captured. Consent is tracked according to a predefined consent framework. mParticle supports the GDPR and CCPA frameworks.
Cortex
Machine learning in the mParticle platform. mParticle also includes functionality for customer data platforms (CDP), and behavioral analytics with Indicative.
credentials
A key and secret used to access the mParticle Events API.
custom event
An event type that can capture any type of user activity in your app. A basic custom event contains a name, a custom event type, and a free-form map of attributes. See alsoatribute.
custom feed
A feed from any data source including the mParticle Events API. Contrast withact-as feed,unbound feed, orplatform input.
custom mapping
The relationship between a custom event, screen view, or commerce event and the corresponding event in the integration partner.
data map
A definition of how one data model equates to another data model in either the same or a different data store.
data model
A definition of how data objects are structured. In Warehouse Sync, a data model may include a data map.
data plan
A codified set of expectations about the extent and shape of your data collected with mParticle. Data plans contain data points and metadata: a plan name, plan ID, version, and description.
data point

environment
Each event batch is associated with an environment: eitherdevelopment(DEV) orproduction(PROD). All development data can be inspected in the Live Stream to enable debugging. You can also create separate event outputs to handle development and production data.
event
A data point that records an action taken by a user in your app. Events are either predefined for use in mParticle or custom events that require mapping. See alsocustom event.
feed
A stream of data into mParticle from either your own data source or a partner. Seeact-as feed,custom feed,platform input, andunbound feed.
field transformation
Specifically for Warehouse Sync, a field transformation is a data map between an external data source and mParticleâs JSON schema. Field transformations define which individual key:value pairs of data in an external data source correlate to which key:value pairs of data in mParticle.
filter
A definition that blocks a data point from being forwarded to a particular output.
forward
Send data from an input to an output.
Generally Available (GA) release
The release of mParticle products or features that are typically available to all customers. Seereleasesfor more details.
GDPR
The General Data Protection Regulation is a set of regulations passed by the European Union. mParticle provides two features to help clients manage their obligations under the GDPR: Consent Management, and Data Subject Request processing.
hot storage
Seeaudience real-time lookback window.
IAM
AWS Identity and Access Management. Using a custom AWS Lambda functionARNto apply rules in mParticle requires the configuration of an IAM User and IAM Role.
identity priorities
The order of precedence for matching user profiles. See alsoidentity strategyandIDSync.
identity strategy
The strategy that determines which user profile to add data to when the current user (known user) can be identified, and what to do when the current user canât be identified (anonymous user).
You are assigned an identity strategy when your org is created.
See alsoidentity prioritiesandIDSync.
IDFA
Identifier for advertisers on iPhones. An Apple IDFA is similar to an advertising cookie, in that it enables an advertiser to understand that a user of a particular phone has taken an action like a click or an app install.
IDSync
A set of mParticle features for managing how you identify your users across devices:identity strategy,identity priorities, and the Identity API.
Indicative
Behavioral analytics in the mParticle platform. mParticle also includes functionality for customer data platforms (CDP), as well as decision making powered by machine learning with Cortex.
input
The configuration that defines how a partner sends data to an output. Inputs may be one of several types:
install
A data point tracked by many mParticle partners, representing the action of a user installing the app on their device. In mParticle, an install corresponds to an Application State Transition event, of typeApplication Launch, where the attributeis_first_runistrue.
integration
The flow of data from one of mParticleâs partners to another. Types of integration include: event, audience, data warehouse, feed, data subject request, and cookie sync. Also referred to asintegration partnerorintegration service.
kit
A component you add to an mParticle SDK that communicates directly with an integration partner from the app client. Usually the kit includes some or all of the partnerâs own client-side SDK. Kits are not the same as SDKs. Also referred to as embedded kits. Kits are typically not needed for server-side integrations.
mapping
Each of mParticleâs integration partners uses a slightly different data structure, with different names for key data points. Mapping is the process of transforming mParticle data into a format that can be used by a partner, and vice versa. For some integration, mapping is customizable. For example, if a partner only collects one user ID, you may need to decide which mParticle identity type to map to the partnerâs user ID. See alsocustom mapping.
Metered Integration
An integration type in which mParticle runs a secondary processing service for mapping data. These integrations consume credits and are enabled by the mParticle account team.
MPID
A unique identifier (64 bit signed integer) that each user is assigned in mParticle to aid in processing identity and profile data.
MAU*
Monthly active users.
MTU
Monthly tracked user, a measurement used in mParticle billing. An MTU is any profile stored in mParticle that has been updated or has generated at least one tracked event within a calendar month. Contrast withVBP.
organization (org)
Each customer of mParticle is assigned an org, which contains one or more accounts. An account contains one or more workspaces. Different features of mParticle are scoped to org, account, and workspace.
output
The configuration that defines how a service receives data from an input via either mParticle servers or directly from the client.
partner
pipeline
Generally speaking, a pipeline is a data definition describing the data that flows continuously from a source to a destination.
platform input
An operating system such as iOS, Android, Roku, or the web that serves as an input. Contrast withact-as feedorcustom feedorunbound feed.
product
mParticle representation of a physical or virtual product or service that your users can buy. Products are referenced in Commerce events.
production (PROD)
Seeenvironment.
premium feature
A feature of mParticle that requires an additional license. Submit a request tomParticle Supportto request a premium feature.
profile
A complete record of what youâve learned about a given user over time, across all channels, continuously updated and maintained in real time as new data is captured.
purchase
A type of commerce event captured when a user of your app buys one or more products.
real-time audience
A set of users connected to an integration for the purpose of engaging those users. Real-time audiences are populated based on recently received data.
Contrast withstandard audience.
releases
mParticle has two types of releases:
BetaAn initial release of products or features thatmParticle expects to make generally available.
mParticle typically offers Beta release functionality free of charge to customers who want to test and provide feedback on future functionality.
General Availability (GA)A release of products or features that have been fully tested and validated for scalability, quality, and usability. Any product or feature not labeled Beta or Early Access (EA) in documentation is a GA release. GA features are rolled out to customers over a period of time.
GA release functionality is available for purchase to all customers.
rule
Rules allow you to cleanse, enrich and transform your incoming data before it is forwarded.
screen event
An event type used for tracking navigation within an app.
SDK
A code library created and maintained by mParticle to track data in your native and web apps. Note that the preferred terminology varies between platforms. This includes native SDKs for iOS and Android, a JavaScript snippet on Web and various libraries, modules, and plugins used for mobile development frameworks like Xamarin and React Native.
server-side
Data forwarded from mParticle servers to an integration partner, rather than directly from a client (such as a mobile device). Server-side integrations typically do not require that a kit be added to the mParticle SDK.
server-to-server
A channel for incoming data such as the Event API.
standard audience
A premium feature that enables you to define and build audiences based on long-term historical data.
Contrast withreal-time audience.
UAV
SeeUser Activity View.
unbound feed
A feed that canât be configured to behave as if it came from a specified platform (there is noAct as Platformoption in the Feed Configuration). Contrast withact-as feed.
user
User attribute change (UAC)
A user attribute change event: anevent_type : attribute_change_event.
An SDK uploads an event whenever a user attribute changes to denote new attributes, changing attributes, and removed attributes. This allows for calculation of the current user attribute state for each event within an mParticle upload.
User Activity View (UAV)
The page in the Activity section of mParticle that allows you to view a detailed summary of data associated with a single user.
user profile
Seeprofile.
VBP
Value-based pricing (VBP), an alternative toMTUmParticle billing. VBP is aligned with a customerâs usage and scales as the customerâs needs grow.
workspace
A workspace is the basic container for data in an mParticle account. An account has one workspace already created; more can be created at any time. These logical containers control different types of scope. For example, the Profile API is set to workspace scope, while the Platform API is set to account scope.
Analytics
event
An event is a tracked user action. Examples of events are a user loading a page, clicking a button, or opening an email. Every analysis in Analytics starts with at least one event to analyze behavioral patterns. You can think of events as the âwhatâ that a user has done.
event property
Event properties describe the context of an event. For example, event properties for the event âButton Clickâ could include the device type used to perform the event, the time zone the event was performed in, or the web browser through which the event was performed.
user property
Analytics isnât just about tracking events, itâs also about tracking user. User Properties are the properties associated with the user performing an event, such as demographic factors, an email address, or the marketing channel through which the user was originally acquired. While event properties can differ from event to event, user properties are associated with every event performed by a given user.
query builder
Every analysis in Analytics is built in thequery builder. Here, you may combine events, event properties, and user properties to create and visualize an analysis.
query row
Aquery rowis a section within a query, and contains events, event properties, and/or user properties that will determine the analysis. A query may be composed of one or more query rows.
value
When an event property or user property is broken apart into its components, these components are referred to as values. For example, when looking at the property âPlatformâ, âiPhoneâ and âAndroidâ are potential values.
numeric value
A value that contains only numbers. Numeric values may be used in calculations. For example, values under the property âPurchase Typeâ containing specific price information are numeric values.
string value
A value that contains letters, numbers, or other characters. String values are not used in calculations. For example, a User ID consisting only of numbers is a string value.
widget
Awidgetis a module on adashboardwithin Analytics. Widgets provide both access to and results from saved analyses. Any analysis built inSegmentation, andCohortmay be added to a dashboard as a widget.

Introduction
The purpose of this guide is to walk you through the basic steps of setting up mParticle in your app, unlocking core functionality, and troubleshooting common issues. Along the way, youâll cover some important concepts you need to understand to be successful with mParticle.
This is not a complete guide to all of mParticleâs features and capabilities. If you already know your way around mParticle and youâre looking for in-depth docs, head to ourDevelopersorGuidessections.
Examples
The tutorials in this guide follow the process of setting up mParticle in the mPTravel app: a mobile and web app that sells luxury travel packages to its users.
Later on in this guide, youâll learn about sending data from mParticle to some of our many integration partners. As examples, the tutorials use services which are simple to set up and verify, and which offer a free account tier, so that you will be able follow the examples exactly if you wish. However, mParticle is agnostic about which integrations you choose and you can follow the same basic steps from this guide to implement any of our integrations.
Inputs and Outputs
One of the key functions of mParticle is to receive your data from wherever it originates, and send it wherever it needs to go. The sources of your data are inputs and the service or app where it is forwarded are outputs. A connection is a combination of an input and output.
Inputs include:
To get started with mParticle, you need some data, which means you need to create at least one input.
Create Access Credentials
The first thing you need to do is to to create a set of access credentials that will allow a client-side SDK or a server-side application to forward data to this workspace.
About Access Credentials
mParticle labels the credentials you create for an integration the key and secret, but they are not exactly like an API key and secret, since you embed these credentials in the app. However, this is not the security risk that exposing API credentials would be:
Most anonymous client-server architectures, including Adobe, Braze, Firebase, Google Analytics, and Segment donât have per-session or per-instance credentials, nor does mParticle.
Install and Initialize an mParticle SDK
You need a developer to help you install and initialize an SDK. See the Getting Started guides for theiOS,AndroidorJavascriptSDKs to get set up before continuing.
Verify: Look for Incoming Data in the Live Stream
Advanced Platform Configuration Settings
For the iOS, Android, tvOS, and Web platforms, some advanced configuration settings are available. To change these settings, navigate toSetup > Inputsin the left column and select either iOS, Android, tvOS, or Web from the list of platforms.
Expand theAdvanced Settingsby clicking the + icon.
Restrict Device ID by Limit Ad Tracking
iOS, Android, and tvOS (Apple TV) devices allow users to limit the collection of advertising IDs. Advertising IDs are unique identifiers you may use to associate event and user data with a specific device. For both iOS and Android devices, if a user has not provided explicit consent to share their deviceâs advertising ID, then the value of that ID is set to an all-zero value.
By checkingRestrict Device ID by Limit Ad Tracking, mParticle will not collect advertising IDs from users who have enabled the Limit Ad Tracking setting on their device.
Remember, mParticle will collect advertising IDs for both iOS and Android devices, regardless of whether or not a user has enabled the Limit Ad Tracking setting on their device. However, the IDs collected from users who have opted out will be all-zero values.
Following are descriptions of Apple and Googleâs policies for device advertising IDs:
After the release of iOS 14.5, Apple introduced the App Tracking Transparency (ATT) framework, which requires app developers to request usersâ explicit consent to share their advertising IDs. If a user of your app has not provided this consent, Appleâs advertising ID (IDFA) will be set to all an all-zero value:00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000. Read more about Apple advertising identifiersin their documentation.
For more information about the ATT framework, visit theiOS 14 Guide.
Google allows Android users to opt out from sharing their devicesâ advertising IDs. Similar to Appleâs policy, Google will set a userâs advertising ID (GAID or AAID) to an all-zero value if that user has opted out from sharing their ID. Read more about Googleâs advertising identifiers intheir documentation.
Collect Integration-Specific Identifiers
The Web SDK can collect integration-specific identifiers to enrich the user data forwarded to your connected outputs.
WhenCollect Integration-Specific Identifiersis checked, these integration-specific identifiers are collected and used to enrich your user data to help optimize the match rate of your audiences in downstream tools. Currently, these identifiers include Facebookâsfbcandfbpfields.
Troubleshoot
If you donât see data appearing in the Live Stream within the first few minutes after opening a development build:
Next Steps
Congratulations, you have created a working data input. Now itâs time tostart capturing some data.

Start capturing data
After you create an input, you can begin capturing data.
Prerequisites
Before you start this activity, you should have already:
Data in mParticle
mParticle collects two important kinds of data:
Event data
Event data is about actions taken by a user in your app. Some events are collected automatically by mParticleâs native SDKs. These include the Session Start events you saw in the Live stream when you firstset up your input. Other events need to be captured by writing code in your app. Of these, the most significant are:
User data
mParticle also captures data about your user, including their identities, information about the device they are using and any custom attributes you set. As with event data, some user data, such as information about the devices they use, is captured automatically by mParticleâs native SDKs. Two important types of user data must be captured by writing code in your app:
User Attributesare key-value pairs that can store any custom data about your user. The value of a user attribute can be:
Capture User and Event Data
To start capturing data you will need to go back to your app code. Inthe previous stepyou should have installed and initialized the mParticle SDK in at least one of your app platforms. This means youâre already set up to capture Session Start and Session End events, as well as basic data about the device. Grab a friendly developer again, if you need one, and try to add some additional user and event data to your implementation. Here are a few things you might try, with links to the appropriate developer docs:
Verify: Look for incoming data in the Live Stream
Once youâve added code to your app to start collecting some basic data, start up a development build of your app again and trigger some events. Have another look at the Live Stream. You should start to see new event batches, with the individual events you have added to your app.

Troubleshoot
If you have at least some data in your Live Stream, such as the session start and session end messages generated in theprevious step, but your screen views, custom events or purchases arenât showing, itâs likely that there is an issue with your app code.
Next steps
Excellent, youâve started collecting real custom datapoints from your app. At this point you might want to take a quick break to:
Now that youâre collecting data, itâs time to send it on byconnecting an event output.

Connect an Event Output
To learn more about event outputs before creating your first one, view the following video:

Prerequisites
Before you start this activity, you should have already:
Outputs
Outputs are mParticleâs term for the services where we forward your data. Outputs are also referred to as âintegrationsâ. Outputs come in two types: âeventâ, and âaudienceâ. Audiences are covered in thenext part of this guide. This section will show you how to set up an event output.
Example - Connect an Output to Analytics
mParticle has over a hundred event outputs, and the connection process for each is similar. This tutorial creates a connection to Analytics as an example. You can follow the same steps with a different output, or create afree Analytics accountto follow along exactly.
Find Analytics in the Directory
Enter the configuration information:
Remember to save your new output configuration.
Create the Connection
Now that you have both an input and an output set up, itâs time to connect them:
Verify: Check that data is arriving in Analytics
Once you have enabled the connection, open up the development build of your app again and create a few more events. Each output service displays the data it receives differently. For Analytics, you can view real-time data in theDebug Console.
Troubleshoot
If you donât see data arriving in the output service, navigate toData Master > Live Streamand select Message Direction Outbound.
If you see messages in the outbound Live Stream, but none in the output service:
If the previous step doesnât resolve the issue:
If there are no outgoing messages in the Live Stream, then mParticle is not attempting to send any data to the output service. Some possible reasons for this include:
Next steps
By now you should be successfully forwarding data to at least one event output. Some additional resources you might want to look at include:
Next up, you will learn about the second category of mParticle data bycreating an audience.

Create an Audience
Prerequisites
Before you start this activity, you should have already:
Get some more data
Up until this point, youâve been testing your account with a single development build of your app. This works well to establish basic data throughput.
The Audiences feature allows you to target segments of your users based on their activity or attributes. So to effectively use Audiences, even at the testing stage, your app needs multiple users!
If youâre not ready to enable the mParticle SDKs in your Production app yet, you can either spin up multiple development environments, or try using theEvents APIto supply some test data in bulk.
Create your Audience
The mPTravel app lets users watch video content about travel destinations. This tutorial creates an audience to allow mPTravel to target users who view content about a paticular destination with deals for that destination.
Create Criteria
There are three distinct aspects of an event criteria that you can define:
Attributes- you can refine your criteria further by setting attribute conditions. This example targets only instances of the Play Video event where the âcategoryâ attribute has a value of âDestination Introâ and the âdestinationâ attribute has a value of âParisâ.
Note that this example creates anExact Matchcondition, but there are other types of condition to explore. For example, if you set âdestinationâContainsâFranceâ, then you could match events with a âdestinationâ of both âParis, Franceâ and âCannes, Franceâ.
The types of condition available depend on what kind of data an attribute holds. For example, an attribute that records a number value will haveGreater ThanandLess Thanconditions. mParticle automatically detects what type of data an attribute holds. However, you can manually set the data type by clicking the type symbol.Donât change the data type unless you really know what youâre doing. If you force the data type to beNumber, and all your attribute values are strings, your condition will always fail! As long as youâre sending the same type of data consistently for each attribute, you shouldnât have to worry about it.
Add Multiple Criteria
You could save this audience right now and target all users who have watched mPTravelâs Paris content in the past three days. But, what if you have some extra special limited deals that you want to save for your premium members? You canât just tell everyone! You need to add a second criteria. Whenever you have multiple criteria, you need to decide how to evaluate them together. There are three options:
To target users who watched Paris content, AND are premium members, chooseAnd.

This is a good opportunity to look at theUsercriteria type, as itâs a little different. Where the other criteria match users who have triggered a particular event, theUsercriteria looks at all other information you might know about your users: the type of device they use, where they live, their custom user attributes, etc. This example targets users with a user attribute of âstatusâ, with a value of âPremiumâ.
When youâve added as many criteria as you need, clickSave as Draftto come back to your definition later, orActivateto start calculating.

When you activate the audience, youâll be asked if you want to set up an A/B Test. SelectNofor now, to go to the Connections Screen.
Verify your Audience
Check that size is greater than zero
After you finish defining your audience you will be taken straight to the Audience Connection screen. Connecting an audience will be covered in the next section.
First, check that your audience definition is working as expected. Start by selectingAudiencesfrom the left column to go to the main Audiences page. Audiences take time to calculate, so if youâve only just activated it, youâll probably see aSizeof 0 for your audience. Mouseover the pie chart to see how far along the calculation process is.

After a while, as long as you have users that match your criteria, you should start to see the value of theSizecolumn increase.

If the audience is 100% calculated, and your size is still zero, there may be an issue with your conditions.
Download to verify individual memberships
In some cases, it might be enough just to know that your audience is matching users. However, if you know specific identities of users who should match your criteria, you can check that they matched by downloading your entire audience in CSV form. Follow the instructionshereto download your audience.
Troubleshoot
For simple audiences, itâs a good idea to check your Live Stream to see if you can find an event that should match your criteria. Here, you can see a user who has triggered the correct event.

Some things to check:
Remember that recalculating an audience will take some time, so check your criteria thoroughly before you save your changes.
Next steps
Congratulations on making your first audience in mParticle! You will have noticed that mParticle populates your options in the Audience Builder based on the data you have captured. This means that as you add new sources, and send more data, you will unlock new options for building audiences. Check in periodically to make sure that youâre getting the most out of your data. Some mParticle clients create hundreds of audiences, each with dozens of chained criteria to target hyper-specific user segments. Youâre only limited by the data you can capture and your imagination.
A few things to read or think about:
Next up, you will learn how toconnect an audienceto one of mParticleâs Audience partners.

Activity
The Activity section of the mParticle platform allows you to view information about your event data.
The following video provides an overview of the Activity dashboard:

Overview
The Activity Overview tracks basic stats for your workspace:

All metrics can be filtered by date range, environment and input.
Identity

Displays summary metrics for identity data collected about your users:
This section is filterable by the date range, environment and input options at the top of the page.
Connections

Displays summary information representing the current workspaceâs usage, showing the following metrics:
Inputs
Outputs
User Activity
The User Activity view allows you to see a detailed summary of data associated with a single user. Note that only users with the Admin or Support roles can access the User Activity view.
To find a user, begin entering any known ID for the user, an email address, customer ID, device ID, etc. The ID must match exactly to return a profile. If multiple profiles are returned, select the user you want from the list.
User Search
You can search for any element in your Identity Set.
To perform a search do the following:

Enter the search terms in the search field.
View individual results by clicking a row. From the individual results you can do the following:
The information shown on this screen is explained in the following sections.
Information
The following user information will be displayed if available:
List of all devices, including the date the device was last seen, device platform (iOS, Android, etc) and whetherLimit Ad Trackingis enabled for the device.
List of all available user attributes. Display priority is given to reserved user attributes:
All other user attributes will be displayed in alphabetical order.
User attribute values may be updated by different inbound data streams. For example, a profile may be created, attributes may be added, updated, or deleted. Each change triggers a timestamp change for the altered attribute. When resolving differences in attribute values for the same profile, the value with the latest timestamp is used.
A list of campaigns, showing Partner and Campaign name.
A list of allAudiencesthe user is a member of.
Events
The Events tab will show a timeline of historical event data from the user,up until the previous day. Events can be filtered by Date, Input, Event Type and Device. In addition to filtering, you can also choose to highlight selected event names in the timeline.
Events are grouped in batches, with the input source in bold. Click a batch heading to view common attributes for the batch, or an event name to view attributes for the event. eCommerce events show details for the transaction and also for each product, including quantity and total price per product.

Click the Link button in the details view to copy a sharable direct link to the event to your clipboard.
As with theLive StreamYou can expand any event or batch to view the raw JSON data.

Edit a user profile
The User Activity View allows you to manually edit certain properties of individual user profiles. This can be useful if you need to correct profile data and you want the updated profile data to be immediately forwarded to your downstream connections.
Whenever you modify user profile data, you must select one of your configured inputs. This allows mParticle to route your changes through that input, updating the user profile, before finally forwarding the changes to any active, connected outputs.
To edit a profileâs user attributes:
On the Information tab for the profile, scroll to the User Attributes section and click theEditpencil icon next to the mParticle workspace where you want to make your changes.




On the Information tab for the profile, scroll to the Consent and Compliance section and click theEditpencil icon next to the mParticle workspace where you want to make your changes.



On the Information tab for the profile, look for the User Details section and click theEditpencil icon.




To add an identity to a user profile:


System Alerts
The System Alerts dashboard reports all errors returned when forwarding data to your connected outputs. This dashboard helps you to find any connections that are failing to forward data, and it can help you to begin debugging a connection you already know is experiencing problems by highlighting the specific errors reported.
System Alerts dashboard
To view system alerts, log into your mParticle account and navigate toActivity > System Alertsin the left nav bar.

The System Alerts dashboard lists all of your connections sorted by their alert volume, from high to low according to alerts reported during the last 12 hours.
You can view alerts reported during different date ranges by using theDatedropdown menu.
To view alerts reported for only the production or development environment, select the environment using theEnvironmentdropdown menu. You can also look for a specific connection with the search bar.
Alert details
To view details on the specific alerts reported for a connection, select it from the list labeledConnections.

The alerts displayed are sorted by volume and organized according to their type. To view the volume of alerts for each input, click the+icon next to the alert type. You can search for a specific alert using the search bar on the System Alerts dashboard.

The following alert types are supported:
Event Forwarding

The Event Forwarding report provides information on your appâs incoming event data and the data that is forwarded to enabled output event services. This is where you can verify how much data mParticle captured per event, and how much data was forwarded.  If multiple configurations are enabled for an integration, the data sent to each configuration will be shown separately. We recommend checking this report if you notice any discrepancies in your vendor dashboards.
The report displays a daily summary of events, plus counts for each message type and event name, along with the inbound and outbound counts for each enabled service.  By default a summary of data for a full day is shown, but you can also select a specific hour to display hourly data.
You may notice differences between an inbound data count and an outbound data count. There are several reasons these differences may occur. Here are some good questions to start with:
Commerce Event Types and Event Forwarding
Four events, called commerce events, capture information about financial transactions: product commerce events, purchase or refund commerce events, promotion commerce events, and impression commerce events.
Commerce events behave differently from other events:
In addition, the expansion behavior is different depending on the commerce event type:

Connect an Audience Output
To forward data out of mParticle, you must create and connect and audience output.
Prerequisites
Before you start this activity, you should have alreadycreated an audience.
How audiences are forwarded
In mParticle, an audience is a set of users who match a given set of criteria. When mParticle prepares to forward an audience, it is broken down into a series of messages about audience membership. Each message contains:
mParticle then translates these messages into a format that can be read by each audience output partner, and forwards them via HTTP API. Each output deals with audience information a little differently, depending on their data structure, but there are two main patterns.
Direct
Some audience output partners allow mParticle to either to directly create an audience (some call them âlistsâ, or âsegmentsâ) via their API, or at least to manage the membership of an existing audience. The end result will be an âaudienceâ in the partner system, containing as many identities from the original mParticle audience as the output can accept. mParticle will continue to update the membership of the audience in the partner system as users are added and removed. Email marketing and social media platforms are usually in this category.
Indirect
Not all audience output services have a concept of âaudiencesâ that mParticle can map to. Others donât allow their audiences to be directly managed via API. In these cases, mParticle usually forwards audiences as some kind of user attribute or tag. Push messaging and other mobile-oriented services often fall into this category.
As an example,Braze, has itâs own audience feature, called âSegmentsâ, but it does not allow mParticle to create segments via API. Instead, for each Braze-supported identity in the audience, mParticle sets a tag on the user, named after the audience. You can then easily find matching users in Braze by searching for that tag.
The catch here is that it is often necessary for the output service to already have a record of the users you want to target. For this reason, this type of audience integration usually works best when paired with a matching event integration.
Example - Connect an audience to Mailchimp
Just like event outputs, each audience output will follow a similar setup process, with the exact prerequisites and settings being different for each. This tutorial forwards an audience to Mailchimp as an example. You can follow the same steps with a different output, or create afree Mailchimp accountto follow along exactly.
Create a Mailchimp List
mParticle sends audiences to Mailchimp via itsList API. For this to work, You need to have already created a list in my Mailchimp account, and you need to know the List ID. You can give your Mailchimp list the same name as the mParticle audience you want to forward.
.
Youâll also need to create a Mailchimp API Key, which you can do from theExtrastab of your Mailchimp Account Settings.

Add the Mailchimp output
Connect your Audience
Verify: Check your list in Mailchimp
The simplest way to check that your Connection is working is to see if your Mailchimp list is showing subscribers. For most audience outputs, mParticle begins forwarding data immediately and continues to update audiences in near real time. For some outputs, however, the design of the output partnerâs API requires that we queue audiences messages and upload at a regular interval. In these cases, we make a note of the upload criteria in the docs for that output.
mParticle forwards to Mailchimp in realtime, and you should be start to see results in the mailchimp dashboard within ten minutes.
Open theListstab in your Mailchimp dashboard. Find the list you used to set up the connection. If you see a positive subscriber count, your connection is working.

Troubleshoot
Many audience outputs are services which allow you to send mass communications or target advertising to wide audiences, so access to the features that mParticle forwards audiences to is often tightly controlled. To be able to view and manage audiences in the output service, you may need to do one or more of the following:
A common question around forwarding audiences is why the size of the audience (or list, or segment) you see in the partnerâs dashboard doesnât match the size of the audience shown in mParticle. This is common, and usually does not mean anything is wrong. When you create an audience in mParticle, we will include as many identities as we have for each user in the audience. However, most outputs only support a small subset of identity types. Hereâs a simple example:

Transform and Enhance Your Data
If youâve followed our guide this far, you have a firm grounding in the basics of mParticle. Now youâre ready to use some of our advanced and premium features to transform, enrich and enhance your data. Here are a few suggestions for where you might want to explore next.
Establish your Identity Strategy
This guide hasalready coveredcollecting identities, such as email addresses, for your users. mParticleâs IDSync feature gives you a lot of control over how you identify and track your users over time, and selecting an Identity Strategy is one of the most important decisions you need to make when implementing mParticle. Read our fullIDSync guidefor more.
Add more sources
For most mParticle clients, the primary sources of data are native and web apps, instrumented with the mParticle SDK, but you can also use mParticle to leverage other sources of data to build a more complete picture of your users:
Explore advanced Audience features
Transform your Data
One of the core benefits of mParticle is the ability to capture data once and forward it to multiple outputs. However, you probably donât want to sendallyour data toeveryoutput. mParticle provides you with a full set of tools to filter and transform your data. Use these tools to control the flow of Personally Identifiable Information (PII), to customize the data you send to each output and to control your costs.
Manage your GDPR Obligations
If you have users in the European Union, you may have obligations as a Data Controller under the General Data Processing Regulation. mParticle provides tools, available as premium features, to help you manage two aspects of GDPR compliance:
Know your limits
Part of the purpose of mParticle is to allow you to maximize leverage of your data without compromising performance. In order to protect the performance of both your app and the mParticle dashboard, we impose certain limits on the data you can send. If youâre a dashboard user, you can read a brief summary of the default limits,here. If you need the full picture, you can read ourdetailed guide.

Profiles
Although processing and forwarding event data is a core function of mParticle, we are not just an integration platform. Our goal is to help you develop a complete view of your users, across all of your data sources, and make that view available wherever it is needed. The user profile is central to this goal.
An mParticle user profile represents a complete picture of what youâve learned about a given user over time, across all of your channels, continuously updated and maintained in real time as you capture new data.
Within mParticle, user profiles serve four core functions:
How Profiles Are Used
Use profiles in mParticle to understand users and create personalized experiences:
User Activity View
Inspect the profile for any user in the mParticle UI via the User Activity View. To find user profiles, you can search by any user identity type you capture, or by the mParticle ID. You can also navigate to the User Activity View for active users in your development environment by inspecting a batch in the Live Stream.
For more information, seeUser Activity.
Profile Enrichment
Profile enrichment allows mParticle to make sure that each of your downstream systems has the most complete and up-to-date information about each of your users. For example, mParticle receives data as batches from native SDKs, our HTTP API and third-party data feeds. Each batch is a JSON object containing an array of events and contextual information about the user, such as identities, user attributes, and device information. mParticle processes the information in each batch and forwards it to downstream systems through event integrations. Before a batch from a particular source is forwarded, mParticle compares it to the matching user profile and adds additional information.

If you collect the same user attribute from multiple sources, for example an iOS app and a web app, mParticle accepts the most recent version. For example, if Bob sets his favorite drink to âBeerâ in the web app, and then changes it to âCokeâ in the iOS app the next day, Bobâs user profile will use the most recent value for enrichment.
Enrichment ensures that all of your downstream tools can receive complete and accurate information about your users. Remember that you can still usedata filtersto prevent downstream systems from receiving user attributes that they donât need.
Profile API
The mParticle user profile can be delivered in JSON format by the Profile API, in order to deliver personalized experiences based on user attributes or audience memberships. To request a profile from the API, supply either the corresponding MPID or a specially configured immutable ID (usually the Customer ID).
For more information, seeProfile API.
Audiences and Calculated Attributes
Audiences allow you to define segments of users based on rule based criteria of their event behavior and profile data. mParticle builds and maintains these segments of users over time which can then be connected to hundreds of outputs for activation.
Audiences and Calculated attributes are built from all your profile data, including calculated attributes, and events that have been collected across all your data sources. For real-time audiences, these are within the audience look back window. Standard audiences utilize your extended Data Retention policy. For more information about data retention, seeData Retention.
For more information, seeAudiencesandCalculated Attributes.
Understanding Profile Data
Two main classes of data provide context about your users and the events they trigger.
User data
User data describes the attributes of individual user profiles. It includes information such as what identities they have, device types and IDs, and a number of custom attributes such as membership status and demographic information. An attribute can reflect either current or previous values, depending on its nature and how often it is updated. User data is stored in profiles.
Event data
Event data describes actions that your users take. They contain information current for the moment at which the event was triggered. For example, the event âSign upâ could have an event attribute of âmembership tierâ, which denotes the membership status at time of signing up. Event data is stored in events.
Profile Schema
Each profile describes useful details about the user associated with the profile.

A user profile contains the following elements:
mParticle ID - a unique identifier for the user within mParticle
The most recently seen IP address associated with the user
For each workspace the user has been seen in:
For each device the user has been seen on:
More about the mParticle schema can be foundhere.
How a Profile Is Updated
Most of the time, mParticle automatically keeps user profiles updated as you capture new data with any of the following methods:
However, sometimes it is necessary to make direct updates to your user profiles in bulk. This happens most often when youâre loading large amounts of data from legacy systems.
To directly update a profile, you can make a standard request to our HTTP API, and leave out theeventsnode. For example:
User attributes updated in this way will not be immediately updated in all downstream event integrations. Most event integrations in mParticle will not process a batch with no events. However, as long as you are sending some event data to each integration, the enrichment process will make sure that user attributes are updated the next time an event is sent for each user.
If it is important for profile updates to be reflected across all your systems immediately, add an event to the batch. For example:
User attributes and input source priority
For a given user, attributes are stored at the workspace level, not the device level.
User attributes are ingested according to the following priority:
Partner data feed (PDF)
Input protections
You can override the default behavior for input feeds, and specify whether data ingested from a feed creates new profiles or updates existing profiles. Choose from one of three input protection levels:
The default profile protection level for all input feeds isCreate & Update.
Profile protection levels are specific to each input configuration, providing more granular control over multiple configurations even if they are contained in a single workspace.
When ingesting user data from an input, mParticle searches for an existing profile that corresponds with any of the user identifiers included with the data. The identity strategy configured for your account determines if a new profile is created when an existing profile canât be found.
You can prevent unwanted changes by defining one or more input protections.
Configure the profile protection level for an input
To set the protection level for an existing input:
When creating a new input feed, you are given the input protection dropdown menu, allowing you to set the protection level for that input from the start.
Create & Update Profiles
This setting removes all restrictions from an inputâs access to a user profile, meaning that new user profiles can be created and modified as data is ingested.
For example, if mParticle receives data from the input that it canât associate with an existing profile and your account uses thedefault identity strategy, then it creates a new profile for the user. If a matching profile was found, the data from the input enriches the found profile.
Only Update Profiles
This setting ensures that only data from known, existing users in the workspace is ingested. If IDSync canât find a matching profile (in other words, if the user is unknown) then the data is discarded. Only existing users within the workspace can be updated, and all other unknown users are ignored.
For example, if mParticle receives data from the input that it canât associate with an existing profile and your account uses thedefault identity strategy, mParticle will not create a new profile for the user and the data will not be associated with an MPID. However, if a matching profile was found, then the user data from the input enriches the found profile.
If an event batch includes user data with an MPID or user identifiers that donât resolve to an existing MPID in your mParticle workspace, mParticle will drop the data and it will not be forwarded to any outputs. However, this is still a billable event due to the processing needed when searching for a matching MPID in your workspace.
Imagine you have a business with a large customer base, but multiple storefronts or customer touch-points. These various touch-points are housed under separate brands and any one customer engages with many of them.
Furthermore, you have chosen to use a centralized data warehouse to help keep your customer data consolidated.
However, you want to ingest customer data into mParticle from your warehouse while maintaining a single user profile for each customer. To do this, you must prevent new profiles from being created. This is where theOnly Updateprotection level is useful.
By setting your data warehouse input feed toOnly Update, mParticle ensures that as new data for a known customer is ingested, that data is attributed to a single user profile. Without this protection, it would be possible for a separate user profile to be created for each of your brands a customer engages with. This would prevent you from maintaining a holistic perspective of your customersâ history.
Only Read Profiles
Prevents all write access to profiles and IDSync. Event batches are ingested normally, but existing profiles canât be modified and new profiles canât be added to protect user profiles and IDsync records from undesired modifications from the input.
For example, if mParticle receives data from the input that it canât associate with an existing profile and your account uses thedefault identity strategy, then it will not create a new profile for the user and the data will not be associated with an MPID. If a matching profile was found, mParticle will not associate the data with the found profile.
If an event batch includes user data with an MPID or user identifiers that donât resolve to an existing MPID in your mParticle workspace, mParticle ingests and forwards the event batch to other outputs, but it will not create a new profile for the MPID.
Keeping your customer data clean and uncontaminated is critical. However, itâs also essential to be able to test new connections from your data warehouses to mParticle.
To configure and test a new input feed from a warehouse without allowing any ingested data to modify your existing customer profiles, you can set the initial protection level for the new feed toOnly Read. This allows you to verify that data is ingested properly, without any of that data leading to the modification or creating of new user profiles.
After youâre confident in your new input configuration, you can change the protection level to allow data from that input to begin enriching profiles.
Data retention and profiles
Profiles are available for different periods of time, depending on thedata retention policyfor your account.

Audiences Overview
mParticle allows you to define sophisticated, intelligent segments and deliver personalized experiences using both rules-based and predictive capabilities. Our machine learning engine analyzes user behavior patterns to help you identify and reach users most likely to take desired actions.
You can define audiences using any user-associated data captured with mParticle, whether from platform inputs or partner feeds, and enhance them with predictive insights.
When you fully instrument your app using the mParticle SDK, you send data from apps to the mParticle platform. This data feeds both traditional segmentation and our predictive models. You can also enrich that data stream with other sources like CRM data or purchase data from other channels. Comprehensive data capture improves both immediate segmentation and predictive accuracy.
Examples
Use audiences to create sophisticated segments powered by both rules and machine learning.
Drive User Engagement Through Intelligent Segmentation
Letâs say you want to target users who installed your app to increase their engagement. There are two approaches to accomplishing this using Audiences:
No matter which approach you take, you can easily forward your audience to push notification and email partners.  Once these audience connections are established, mParticle instantiates a corresponding audiences both partners.  No coding is necessary.
Drive app downloads
Letâs say you want to find more users like your currently highly engaged users and run an app download campaign in Facebook against that target audience. You start by defining your highly engaged users, using whatever criteria is important to you: lifetime value metrics, session activity, event activity, or any other data points you capture.
Once your audience is defined, configure the Facebook integration and corresponding custom audiences in your Facebook account.  From there you can leverage the custom audiences like any other custom audience in Facebook.
Because we want to target users that look like our highly engaged users, we will create a Facebook lookalike audience from our highly engaged user audience and run a Facebook app install campaign that targets that lookalike audience.

Connections
mParticle provides multiple data flows to ensure different kinds of data travel from a client application or the web (input) to a destination (output).
Data Forwarding and Connections
Data about an event, including individual attributes, may be forwarded from the input to an output in a variety of ways:

Some integrations allow you to choose either server-side or client-side when you configure a connection.
Connection Workflow
No matter which data flow your integration uses, a connection is required. A connection is the combination of an input, an output, and the configuration information required to make the connection work. Most of the configuration information is specified in the mParticle UI, but some values may need to be fetched from the output, and you may need to add a kit to an SDK for some client-side integrations.
The Connections screen controls how event data from your inputs (iOS, Android, Web, Feeds, etc) is forwarded to your output platforms. You must set up a separate connection for each input-output-configuration combination. For each connection, you have several opportunities to cleanse and filter your data, to ensure that each output receives the data you want it to receive, in the correct format.

Each output has its own requirements, so the process for setting up each connection is a little different. However, all connections require these basic steps:
Create a Connection
Data flows once an input and output are connected and the connection is active. For an overview before you create your first connection, view the following video:

1. Select an input
2. Apply âAll Outputsâ transformations
Once you have an input selected, you can set up transformations that are applied to all outputs connected to that input. ClickAll Outputsto see options.
There are two transformations that can be applied here:
3. Select an Output
Once you have selected an input, you will see a list of available outputs that can receive data from your selected input. If this list is empty, go toSetup > Outputsto create some outputs.
The following video shows how to create an output:

The mParticle UI may indicate that you need or may need to add a reference to a kit in your platform dependency configuration. You can do this after you create the connection but before you change theConnection Statusto active. SeeAdd a Kitfor more information.
4. Complete Connection Settings
Complete any settings that apply to the connection. These will be different for every output but can include:
The minimum platform version of your input that the connection will forward data from.
If you set theMin Platform Versionconnection setting, then mParticle will only forward data from inputs with anapplication_versionthat is equal to or greater than the version you set. This allows you to create a separate connection for different versions of your app.
5. Apply âSpecific Outputâ transformations
The second set of transformations apply only to your selected Output. ClickSpecific Outputto see options. Specific output transformations include:
Add a Kit
When you configured your output in step 3, the mParticle UI may have indicated that you do need or may need a kit added to the SDK for your app or web pages:
If so, check the integration documentation for your output. If a kit is required, follow the instructions for adding the kit to your input platform dependency configuration.
Activate the Connection
After you have completed the required settings, set up any transformations, and added a kit (if needed), you are ready to activate the connection:
Very large data volumes may take up to 48 hours to process. To reduce processing time, reduce the number of sessions your account sends to fewer than 200,000 per day.
Verify Your Connection
Verify that data is flowing. Check in the mParticle UI and in your downstream app or system (output).
OpenData Master > Live Streamand select the following values:

If you donât see events being forwarded,troubleshoot your connection.
To verify that data is arriving n the downstream system:
If you donât see events being forwarded,troubleshoot your connection.
Troubleshooting Connections
Follow these steps to troubleshoot an event connection:
Still not sure whatâs wrong? ContactmParticle Support.
All Outputs Transformations
SeeRulesfor more information on all-output rules.
Specific Output Transformations
mParticle lets you customize the data that you send to each output. There are many reasons to do this, including:
The Data Filter
Unlike other transformations, the data filter exists on its own page, separate from the Connections screen. A data filter allows you to decide which events/attributes you want to send to each output. By default, all event attributes are enabled when you first activate a connection. From the event filter you can:
SeeThe Data Filterfor more information.
Forwarding Rules
Like the event filter, forwarding rules let you filter out events from being sent to an Output. But where the event filter is based on event and attribute names, forwarding rules look at values, which lets you build some more complex conditions. There are several types of forwarding rules.
User Sampling
User Sampling is applied to a single output and sends only a subset, or sample of your data to an output. The main reason to do this is to control costs on services that charge by volume of data. Data is sampled on a user level, not an event level - if you select a 50% sample, mParticle forwards all data received from half of your users, not half of each userâs data.

Specific Output Rules
SeeRulesfor more information about specific-output rules.
Custom Mappings
Some services allow your incoming events to be translated into events specific to the service. For example, if you have a custom event named âNextLevelâ, typically this event would be forwarded as a custom event to a service. With custom mappings, you can specify that this event be forwarded to a service using their specific event name. For example:
For partners that support custom mappings, the outputâs events are listed on the left side of theCustom Mappingstab. For each event, you can then select an mParticle event and associated attributes to map to the partnerâs event.

The following integrations support custom mappings:
If an event has a Custom Mapping for a particular connection, it will be displayed with an icon in the Event Filter

If you turn off forwarding of an event with a Custom Mapping, the mapping information will be deleted.
mParticle Forwarder Module
The final and most crucial transformation step is the mParticle Forwarder Module itself.
After all your other transformations have been completed, the forwarder module turns your data into messages to the output in its preferred format.
Each integration has its own forwarding module. Settings for the forwarder are derived from three places:
Based on these settings, mParticle transforms your data into a format accepted by the output. This can involve extensively reformatting the data. For example, Mixpanelâs API accepts events, with attributes given as a flat set of key-value pairs. To fit this structure, a single mParticle eCommerce event with four products will be transformed into four Mixpanel Events - one for each product - with common attributes, such as user and device info, repeated for each event.
The documentation for each integration will tell you what you need to know about how data is transformed to be accepted by the Output service.
Best Practice for Transformations
mParticle provides many opportunities to transform and enrich your data. It is often possible to perform the same transformation in more than one place. For example, if you wanted to drop all Application State Transition events for a given output, you could use the event filter, or you could write a condition in an output rule. There are advantages to each choice. The event filter can be used by anyone with the appropriate access to your organization in the mParticle Dashboard, so it is easy to update and maintain. Writing a rule gives you much finer control over your data, but rules may be difficult for non-developers to understand or alter.
Make the necessary transformations to your data in as few steps as possible. The fewer times you alter your data, the easier your integration will be to troubleshoot and maintain.

Create an Audience
Creating an audience begins with defining your use case, segmentation approach, and engagement strategy. To do this, consider the following questions:
Example Use Cases
Retaining users is crucial for the sustained success of a mobile application. By identifying and re-engaging inactive users, you can boost overall engagement and reduce churn.
Goal:Improve user retention by targeting users who have not opened the app in the last 7 days.Segmentation Strategy:Identify users who have been inactive for a week but used the app actively within the previous month.Engagement Strategy:Send personalized push notifications offering a discount or exclusive content to re-engage users.
Leveraging predictive analytics allows businesses to anticipate user behavior and proactively engage those most likely to convert, thereby optimizing marketing efforts.
Goal:Increase conversion rates by targeting users predicted to make a purchase in the next 7 days.Segmentation Strategy:UtilizePredictive Audiencesto identify users with a high likelihood of purchasing based on machine learning models analyzing past behaviors and interactions.Engagement Strategy:Deliver personalized email campaigns featuring product recommendations or special offers to these high-likelihood purchasers.
Identifying subscribers at risk of churning enables proactive engagement strategies to maintain a stable subscriber base.
Goal:Minimize churn by identifying at-risk subscribers.Segmentation Strategy:Identify users whose subscription renewal is within the next 30 days and who have decreased engagement (e.g., fewer logins or interactions).Engagement Strategy:Offer these users tailored incentives such as a loyalty bonus or a discounted renewal rate to encourage continued subscription.
Create a New Audience
Once you have clearly defined your use case, itâs time to begin building your audience.
Navigate to the Audience Creation Page
Configure Your Audience Group
Individual audiences are contained within folders calledAudience Groups. The first step in creating a new audience is to set the configurations for this folder:

Define Your Audience
After saving your audience group, youâll enter theEditor. Here is where you can add, view, edit, and connect audiences.
Follow the steps below to create your first audience within this folder:
After you have added your first criteria, a number displays that represents the estimated audience size:.
This estimate is based on a sample of data. As you continue to add criteria, you will see an estimated size for both individual criteria as well as for the whole audience.
Audience Preview
After defining your audience criteria, you can use thePreviewtab to inspect a sample of users that match your current segmentation. Audience Preview helps validate audience composition before activation, reducing errors and improving targeting accuracy.
How to Use Audience Preview
Each row in the preview includes:
Last Seenâ The most recent interaction timestamp.

Connect an Audience
Once you have created an Audience, the next step is to connect it to an audience output where you can activate it. Visit ourIntegrationspage and filter by Audience to view all audience outputs.
Create Audience Output
To add an audience output:
You can view and update your configurations at any time by navigating to Setup > Outputs, and selectingAudiencetab.
Connect Your Audience
Once you have created at least one audience output, you can connect your audience to begin sending data to that vendor.
How Audience Forwarding Works
When mParticle forwards an Audience to an output, only identity data is sent by default. While mParticle can collect various identity types for both devices and users, most audience partners accept only a limited set of identities based on their specific needs. For example, an email marketing partner may only accept email addresses, a push messaging partner may only accept push tokens, and a mobile advertising platform may only accept device advertising identifiers (IDFA for iOS and GAID for Android).
When building your Audiences in mParticle, you donât need to worry about which identities a partner supports. Simply define your Audience criteria, and mParticle will forward all available identities that each partner accepts.
Example
You define an Audience with criteria that matches 100 profiles.
You create connections to two outputs:
mParticle will automatically forward the data to each partner:
You donât need to track which identities are available per profileâmParticle handles the process seamlessly.
Selective Attribute Forwarding
When forwarding data to an Audience output, you have the option to selectively forwardUser Attributesbeyond the identities that are required for engagement. Forwarding Calculated Attributes like LTV or Predictive Attributes like propensity scores, for example, enables you to use richer data in your activation platforms. Not all integrations support this â when you connect your Audience you will see what is supported.
In the last step of the process to connect an output, select which account and workspace level attributes you would like to forward to that particular tool:

Manage Audiences
Audiences Landing Page
The Audiences landing page is a central hub from which you can view and manage all of your audiences in mParticle. To access it, selectSegmentationin theOverview Map, then clickAudiencesin the left-hand navigation.

Audiences Table Columns
The columns of the audiences table display key information about each of yourAudience Strategiesandindividual audiences:
Some statistics, such asSize, Adds, Drops, and Volatility, are only displayed at theAudience leveland not forAudience Strategies/Groupings. If a value isnât applicable at the Strategy level, it will be displayed asâ-âin the table.
To customize the columns that are visible in the table:
Audience Strategies vs. Audiences
Individual audiences are contained within folders calledAudience Strategies. The main table in the Audiences landing page displays all of your audience strategies and their associated audiences. Click the+icon to the left of an audience strategy name to expand and hide the audiences it contains:

Note: The example above shows an A/B test, which produces individual audiences for the control and test variants.
Audience Tags
As you continue to create new audiences, you can use tags to keep them organized and allow team members to easily see the purpose of each audience at a glance. For example, you can use tags to group your audiences by campaign type, giving them names like retargeting, lead gen, and product launch. Once you have applied tags, you can use tag names as search queries to return all audiences that have that particular tag applied.
Create a new tag
On the Audiences landing page:

To add additional tags, select the name of the tag(s) that have already been applied, open the dropdown menu, and click the additional tags you would like to add.
Update an existing Audience Strategy / Audience
To update an existing Audience or Audience Strategy, click on its name in the audience table. This will display the Audience Builder modal (if you selected an audience) or the Audience Strategy Editor (if you selected an audience strategy). Here, you can update the inclusion criteria for this particular audience, or update / add features like new paths, additional audiences, or A/B tests.
At any time after an Audience Strategy has been created, you can edit its data inputs.
Share Audiences between accounts
You can share audiences between your organizationâs accounts, with detailed control over what data is shared. Share data broadly or restrict it to only whatâs needed for a campaign. This feature does not affect data shared with third-party tools.
In the modal, you can view the accounts the audience is shared with and their sharing permissions. There are four sharing permission levels:
To view audiences that have been shared with an account, navigate toSegmentation, then selectShared Audiencesin the left-hand navigation.

Real-time Audiences (Legacy)
This feature enables you to define audiences and connect them to integrations for the purpose of engaging with your users.  This can be very powerful for user engagement and monetization scenarios.
You can define audiences from any user-associated data you capture with mParticle, whether from platform inputs or partner feeds.
Real-time audience page
VisitAudiences > Real-timeto see a list of your audiences, and a count of how many active audiences you are using.
Audiences are separated intoSingle Workspace,Multi Workspace, andShared With Metabs. The ** tab shows metrics for each real-time audience, including:
Workspaces, inputs, and audience criteria
Every audience is populated from data sources that you specify when you create the audience:
Because user and device identities are scoped at the workspace level, not the input level, they are available to all audiences in a workspace, for all inputs defined in the workspace, regardless of which input is selected for an audience.
For example, if a profile is seen in a workspace in the audience scope, mParticle extracts all identities from the profile and uses them to evaluate against the audience criteria. Thus, if an audience is scoped to input A in a workspace, and a profile is seen from input B in the same workspace, user and device identities will be available for evaluation in an audience with input A, as long as A and B are both inputs defined in the same workspace.
Create a real-time audience
The audience workflow is simple:
Define use case
Before you create audiences, define your segmentation and engagement strategies:
These decisions drive your implementation.
Example: Audience Suppression
The following video shows how to create an audience that excludes users from a particular campaign or from all campaigns:

Create an audience
Before you create your first audience, the following video may help you understand the overall process:

To create an audience:
SelectAudiencesfrom the main navigation, and then selectSingle Workspace, orMulti Workspaceif your input sources are in multiple workspaces, and clickNew Audience.

Enter theAudience Name. You also have the option to provide anExternal Name. If provided, the external name is forwarded to Audience connections.
If you have enabledUnlimited Lookback, the date range is not displayed.
This screen shows a single Workspace Audience. Clicking theMultiple Workspace Audienceselection from the main navigation shows a dialog asking if you would like to switch to theMultiple Audience Workspacescreen.
Define audience criteria
After you create an audience, you can specify criteria to further define it.
The scope of data that is evaluated by your audience criteria is dependent upon:
The full audience definition is available once it is created. This means, for example, that you can create an audience, and before it is finished calculating, create a second audience that excludes members of the first audience. The first audience definition is available in full to the second audience definition, even if calculations are not complete.
To add criteria to the audience definition:

After you define a criteria with the real-time audience builder a number displays that represents the estimated audience size:
When the calculation is complete, you can see the estimated size for an individual criteria next to theAppicon, and the estimated size of the whole audience in the Audience Details section. If there arenât enough users in the sample data to estimate audience size, youâll see a~without a number as illustrated in the example above.
To add criteria to your audience definition:
Click one of the following buttons once you have completed the definition of your audience:
The audience builder allows you to build criteria based on two sources of data:
As you define your audience criteria, a list of suggested matching values will appear based on what youâve entered.
This feature works both when building new audiences and fine-tuning existing ones, helping you save time, reduce manual effort, and improves accuracy.
To use this feature, you must have one of the following standard Roles:User,Admin,Audiences-only,Support, orAdmin+Compliance. Alternatively, you can create a Custom Role with any of the following tasks:audiences:draft,audiences:edit,catalog, oraudiences.
As mentioned above, you can build audience criteria based on user attributes from the user profiles. These attributes can be of any data type including: numbers, strings, dates, lists, booleans, etc. All user profile data is scoped and maintained within a single workspace; In multiworkspace audiences, you can select which workspace to use by pressing the number in the top right of the criteria in the audience builder.
To build an audience criteria based on a userâs profile information, press theadd criteriabutton and selectUsersto view options for user based criteria:

When building audiences based on string attributes, several matching rules can be applied. All matches are case insensitive.
There are two ways to build time-based criteria for audiences: by recency, and by date. Recency criteria define a period in time in relation to ânowâ, when the audience is actually being calculated, for examplewithin the last 7 days. Date criteria are based on fixed calendar dates which do not move in relation to when the audience is calculated. For example,after 09/12/18.
Keep in mind that audiences defined using fixed calendar dates will have a shorter useful lifespan, as the audience builder only uses data from within a set range (last 30 days for most customers).
Recency-based criteria select events occurring between two moments in time, relative to ânowâ. A âdayâ represents 24 hours, and not a calendar day. For example, consider the following criteria:

If this audience is calculated at 1:00pm on September 9th 2018, then the earliest qualifying event would occur at 1:00pm on September 3rd, and the latest qualifying event would occur at 1:00pm on September 5th.
Date-based criteria are concerned with calendar dates in UTC time and are not defined in relation to when the audience is calculated.
Attribution criteria can be used to segment users who have installed your app from a specific campaign and publisher or users who have purchased or re-engaged based on an engagement campaign. There are two ways to add attribution criteria:
Identity criteria allow you to segment users based on their stored identities to test existence of a given identity or write logic against the identity as a string. This criteria will still scope the audience based on the workspaces included; It will not automatically include all users in theIdentity Scope. For example, if the identity scope is set at the account level and the account has 3 workspaces, an audience created in one workspace will only include users with activity in that workspace (and not the other two).
Segment users by their location these two options available underUsers,Location:
When using our Ecommerce events, you can easily target users that have added products to their cart, but not completed a purchase by usingcart abandonmentcriteria:
From here you can define how long to wait without seeing aproduct actionto include them in this audience.

UseExists / Not Existsto check for the presence of an attribute.
For example, User Attribute Gender EXISTS evaluates as true for Gender = âFemaleâ and also evaluates true for Gender ={undefined}.
Set up an audience output
The next step is to connect the audience to an output service that can use the data.  See ourIntegrationsdirectory for a full list of output options.
To add an audience output:
Find the integration you want in theDirectory. You can filter the Directory to show only partners with an Audience Configuration.

Click the card for your chosen partner.
Click+ Add {partner} to Setupand, from the popup dialog, selectOutput Audience.

Complete theConfiguration Settingsdialog. Each partner will require slightly different information. Some require an API Key/Secret/Token, others require you to log in from mParticle using Oauth. See theIntegrations Centerfor details for your integration. Give the configuration a name and clickSave.

You can update your configurations at any time by navigating toSetup > Outputs, and selectingAudience Configurations.
Connect an audience
Once you have set up your output configuration, you can connect the Audience you have defined in mParticle.

Any users that fit your audience criteria will begin to be available in the output platform. Some integrations take longer than others for this to happen. See the documentation for your specific integration for details.
When mParticle forwards an audience to an output, we are only sending identities. mParticle is capable of collecting many types of identities for both devices and users, but most Audience partners will only accept the limited set of identity types that they actually use. For example, a partner that handles email marketing may only accept email addresses, a push messaging partner may only accept push tokens, and a mobile advertising platform may only accept device advertising identifiers (IDFA for iOS and GAID for Android).
When building your audiences in mParticle, you donât have to worry too much about this. You can simply define your matching criteria, and mParticle will forward to each output as many available identities for each matching user as that partner accepts.
You define a set of audience criteria, and mParticle finds 100 matching profiles.
All profiles include one Apple Advertising ID (IDFA), but only 65 include one email address.
You create connections to two Outputs: Partner A accepts IDFA and GAID identity types. Partner B accepts only the email identity type.
Itâs not necessary for you to know which profiles have which identity types. mParticle simply forwards the 100 available IDFAs to Partner A, and the 65 available email addresses to Partner B.
User profiles and identities
mParticle creates audiences by comparing your matching criteria with each user profile. If a profile fits the criteria, each accepted identity included in the profile is forwarded to any connected Outputs.
User profiles can contain data â including identities â collected from multiple workspaces. Even if your matching criteria only concerns data from a single workspace, once a matching user profile is found,allaccepted identities are forwarded to the output, even if the identities were collected in a different workspace.
You have created 2 workspaces in your account to track activity for two related apps, App A and App B. User John Smith signs up for both apps, using the email addressjohn.smith@example.com. However, he uses his iPad for App A and his iPhone for App B. This means that there are two different IDFA identities associated with John Smithâs profile. (note: read ourIDSyncdocumentation to understand more about how profiles with multiple identities are managed).
You create an audience in the App A workspace, and your criteria match John Smithâs user profile. When you connect that audience to an output that accepts IDFAs, mParticle will forward both of John Smithâs IDFAs.
Common settings
The following video explains some of the common settings you use when creating an audience.

Audience estimator
Each audience that you create provides an estimated audience size immediately, so that you donât have to wait for the audience calculation to complete. Once an audience has at least one active connection, mParticle begins calculating the real size, and shows an estimate until the calculation is complete.
To estimate the audience size quickly, mParticle samples the total number of users.
You see the estimated size of the audience with all criteria applied.
Use the audience estimatorâs immediate feedback to adjust criteria definitions and parameters if needed. For example, the audience size is much bigger or much smaller than expected.
After the audience has been fully calculated, the display changes to show the actual audience size.
In some cases, you may see different symbols instead of an estimated size:
Audience A/B testing
Audience A/B Testing allows you to split an audience into two or more variations and create connections for each variation independently, to help you to compare the performance of different messaging platforms. For example, if you have an audience of low engagement users that you want to reengage with your app, you might devise a test like this:
You can then compare the engagement outcomes for each group and apply the most successful strategy to the entire audience.
Create a test


Create a connection
Once you have defined your variations, you can connect each variation, including the âControlâ variation, to any output. There is also an option to connect your full audience to any output. From theConnecttab, select the variation you want to connect and follow the standardconnectionflow.

In theAudiencessummary screen, audiences with an active A/B test will be marked with a%symbol.

Note that whenever the Audience Name is used in forwarding the audience to downstream partners, variant audiences will be named using the format[Audience External Name] - [Variant Name].
Change an audience definition
You can edit an audience definition without affecting the audience split, even after connecting to an output. When the audience is updated, the variants will still be balanced as defined when you created the test.
End a test
When you are ready to end a test, navigate to theA/B Testtab and clickDelete Test

Deleting a test will delete all variations and any connections you have set up for each variation.
Download an audience
You can download a calculated audience as a CSV file. This is useful if you want to troubleshoot your audience criteria, or if you want to share your audience data with a partner without an official mParticle Audience integration.
Audience downloads take some time to prepare depending on the volume of users in the audience, ranging from a few minutes up to ~6 hours for extremely large audiences.
Audience downloads are available on Real-time audiences only. To download a Standard Audience, connect and send it to an infrastructure output, like Amazon S3 via a Kinesis connection, and download it from there.
Initiate a download
You can initiate an Audience download, either from the mainAudiencespage:

or from theAudience Detailstab of an individual audience page:

If the Audience includes A/B Testing Variants, you can select which variants you want to download.

You can also choose to download an audience sample. Downloading a sample will likely take less time than downloading a full audience (depending on the audience size), and is useful for testing or troubleshooting.

You also need to select the identity types you want.

Download the file
The download takes some time to prepare. When your download is ready, you will receive an email with download link.

Download format
The download will be a ZIP file which, when extracted, will contain a CSV file for each audience or variant, plus amanifest.jsonfile, with metadata about the csv files.
Audience CSV files have a row for each identity in the audience. Remember that a single user profile can have multiple identities and, therefore, multiple rows.
The four columns show a unix timestamp for when the audience membership was retrieved, the mParticle ID of the profile, the identity type, and the value:
The Manifest file will be in JSON format. See the following example for included fields:
Delete an audience
An audience can be deleted in the UI in a few ways, described as follows.
In the Audience Overview:

In the Audience itself:

An audience can also be deleted with thePlatform APIusing the/audiencesendpoint.
Note that if an audience is nested in another audience for exclusion or inclusion criteria, it canât be deleted.  It must be removed as nesting criteria for all audiences before being deleted.  If attempting to delete an audience nested in other audiences, the following message displays:

Integrations behave differently downstream after an audience is deleted:
Bulk audience connections
If you have defined a large number of audiences that you want to send to an output, you can establish the connections for many audiences at once, rather than doing them one at a time.



You will see a status message showing all successful audience connections. If any audiences cannot be connected, error details will be shown.
Audience tags
As you continue to add audiences, you can use tags to help keep them organized. A tag is simply a label you can use to sort and search for audiences. For example, if you give all of your retargeting audiences a tag named âRetargetingâ, you can easily find them all by filtering for the tag. You can add/remove tags for an audience directly from the Audience page, or in the audience settings. If you select more than one tag, the Audience page shows only audiences with both tags.
There is no limit to the number of tags you can create, but each tag name is limited to 18 characters or less.
If you clone an audience, itâs tags will be cloned, also.

Audience faults
If mParticle encounters errors forwarding an audience to an output, it will mark the connection as faulted. Audience Faults are visible from the Audience page, the Audience Connection screen, and the Audience tab onSetup > Outputs.
While an Audience is faulted, mParticle will stop trying to forward audiences until the fault is resolved.
Click the fault icon to view a detailed error message.
If you canât determine the cause of the fault, the most common causes of faults include:
Authentication
When you believe you have resolved the issue, open the fault notification and clickResumeto resume sending data.
User attribute sharing
mParticleâs Audience User Attribute Sharing feature allows you to include user attributes along with identities when you connect a supported audience connection. This allows you to use richer data in your activation platform, such as LTV, lead score or propensity to convert.  This feature does not forward or share your user data to any company beyond what you are explicitly configuring as an audience connection.
Set up user attribute sharing
Set up user attribute sharing in three steps.
Create the Audience Connection in the usual way. For affected partners, you will see the following notification:

If you want to forward User Attributes to this partner, make sure you set the Status to Inactive as you create the connection. This will make sure you do not begin forwarding data until you have selected the user attributes to forward.
From the connection screen, select the User Attributes you want to include. By default, all attributes are disabled. It may take up to 15 minutes before attributes begin to be forwarded.

Once you have selected the User Attributes you want to forward,Save and Activatethe Audience, open theSettingsand set theStatustoActiveto begin forwarding identities.
Profiles and user attribute forwarding
mParticleâs user profile stores user attributes across platforms, workspaces and accounts. This means that, if your audience output uses device IDs, and if you are tracking a user across multiple platforms (mobile and web, for example) you may be able to forward user attributes that were not collected on the targeted mobile devices.

Standard Audiences (Legacy)
The mParticle Standard Audiences feature enables you to define and build audiences based on long-term historical data.
Standard Audiences differ from Real-time Audiences, in a few key ways:
Calculation credits
Standard audiences are purchased by buying annual calculation credits. Each calculation credit lets you run a calculation across 365 days of your historical data, regardless of how many audiences are included. You can calculate many standard audiences at once. There are prompts in the product to select the audiences to calculate and confirm how many credits you are spending.
Some example calculations and costs:
Standard audience lifecycle
Standard audiences have a 4 stage lifecycle:
Expired: 30 days after a standard audience is calculated, it is expired and appears in the Expired tab inAudiences > Standard.
Workflow
1 - Create a new standard audience
Standard Audiences are managed separately from Real-time audiences. ChooseAudiences > Standardfrom the main navigation menu, and clickNew Standard Audience.

2 - Define date range and inputs
Just as withreal-time audiences, you can define which inputs you want use to calculate the audience. For Standard Audiences you also need to define a date range. You can chooseAll available dataor define any period within the available range. When youâre ready, clickCreate. The start and end dates are inclusive and it uses the UTC timezone.

3 - Define audience criteria
Define your audience by clicking the plus sign to create and define one or more criteria. This step is the same as inreal-time audiences. When your definition is ready, clickSave as Draft. Notice that after a moment, aCalculatebutton displays next to the grayed-outSave as Draftbutton.

4 - Calculate one or more audiences
At the top of the Standard Audiences page from step 3, clickCalculate.
Select any additional DRAFT audiences from the list to add them to the calculation. This modal shows you how many calculation credits will be deducted from your account. When youâre ready clickStart Calculation.

5 - Set up one or more connections
At first your audience shows asCalculatingin the list viewStatuscolumn underAudience Details. While you wait for the calculation to complete, you can set up one or more audience connections by clicking the green plus sign in theConencted Outputscolumn.
Calculation can take many hours for large amounts of data. You can track progress via a popup in theSizecolumn.
The Connections screen functions the same as forreal-time audiences. Add and configure one or more connections. The only difference is that when you save the connection, no data is forwarded until you explicitly send the audience.
6 - Send your calculated audience
Once your audience is completely calculated, you can see it in theReadytab. Click Send next to an Audience to go back to theConnectionsscreen.

From theConnectionsscreen clickSend. You can also adjust your output connections here as needed.

Select one or more audience Outputs and clickSend.

All members of the audience are forwarded to the output.
Calculated audience will remain in theReadytab for30 days, after which they will need to be recalculated and can be found in theArchivetab. Once an audience is in the archive tab, you can clone and recalculate it.  Remember that the audience will not be updated in real time. If you want to update the audience, you must run the calculation again.

Data Filter
A key benefit of mParticle is the ability to collect your data only once, no matter how many places you need to use it. However, you probably donât wantallof your data going to every output service you use. For this reason, mParticle provides the Data Filter as a simple way to control the flow of data to your outputs.
The Data Filter displays a complete list of all data points (a data point can be an event, an attribute of a user or event, or a user identifier) collected in your workspace, and allows you to disable forwarding of any individual data point to any of your output services.
The following video explains data filtering in mParticle:

Find Your Data Points

The first time you visit the Data Filter, you will see an empty grid. To start filtering you need to:
Disable Data Points
You can filter event data at 3 levels: Event Type, Event Name and Event Attributes.

It's important to remember that the Data Point Filter is independent from the mParticle forwarders that handle transforming and forwarding your data to each output service. It includes switches for every data point, even if that data point is never forwarded to a particular output service. For example, Amplitude only accepts Customer ID and Email Address as User IDs. Leaving the filter switches on for other ID types will have no effect.
Always check the documentation for each integration for details on what data is forwarded.

New Data Points
The Filter allows you to disable any current data point from being forwarded to any current output service. However, as you continue to use mParticle, update your app instrumentation, and add inputs, you will continue to generate new data points. One of the most important decisions to make in the Filter is how to handle new data points for each output service. By default, mParticle will automatically forward new data points to each output service. If you uncheck theSend new data points by defaultbox, no new data points will be forwarded to that output until you explicitly enable it in the Filter.
New data points will be added to the Data Filter the first time mParticle receives them. It should only take a few minutes from mParticle receiving a data point for it to be visible in the Data Filter.

Shortcuts
A mature mParticle project may have hundreds of events. Thatâs a lot of filter switches. To save you time, we provide some convenience methods to help you set your filters quickly. To access the shortcuts for an output service, click the elipsis near the top of the column.

Calculated Attributes Overview
A calculated attribute (CA) measure usersâ aggregate behaviors, and store this information in new user attributes, such as customer lifetime value, total games played or content watched, or the last product viewed. You define a calculated attribute in mParticle and, once activated, they are computed automatically over time by using the raw data stream of events and user information. Once youâve created calculated attributes, you can use them as segmentation criteria in Audiences, Profile API, or connect them downstream to any of your tools. This is incredibly powerful, and can be set up with a few button clicksâno SQL, no pipeline management.
You can define calculated attributes to track almost anything on an individual user, from counting the number of logins in the last 30 days or knowing the last product category viewed, to more complex calculations like the customerâs average order revenue or the most frequent purchase.
Calculated attributes provide value in many ways:
The following video explains how calculated attributes help you quickly generate customer insights without needing any developer resources:

Calculated attributes basics
A calculated attribute contains the following elements that you define:
Scope
Calculated attributes are defined and calculated per workspace; calculations use data available within the same workspace where they are defined. You can create calculated attributes with the same name and functionality in multiple workspaces.
Initialization
After you activate a calculated attribute, it initializes using existing data in the mParticle CDP along with any seeded value that was sent usingSeeding API. Depending on the date range selected in the calculated attribute definition, this can take several hours. After initialization, calculated attributes continue to recalculate with new data.
Calculation speed

Calculations are eithersynchronous(sent with the batch of data being processed) orasynchronous(sent with the next batch):
Calculation categories
We currently support 13 calculations organized into four categories:
For a list of calculations and details about each, seeCalculated Attributes Reference.
For an overview of how to use calculation categories, view the following video:

Calculation date range
Calculated attributes can apply to a date range that you choose:
Since: limit calculations to the period of a specified start date to now.

Note that above the date range selection drop-downs, the UI displays the date that data was first ingested into mParticle.
You can choose a date earlier than the first date that data was ingested, however, mParticle only calculates as of the earliest ingestion date.
Conditional logic
After selecting an event, you can add conditions to the attribute in order to more precisely define results. For example, a retailer creating a calculated attribute might use the Contains operator with a Count attribute to count only the purchases that contain âSockâ in the product name. For a complete list of operators for the four categories of attributes (Count, Aggregation, Occurrence, and List), seeConditions.
Calculation attribute seeding
Seeding allows you to pass in historic values for calculated attributes that mParticle builds on as new data arrives, without passing in the raw events. Seeding allows you to transition from your own calculations to mParticle calculation. For example, you may have data from outside mParticle about the last four monthsâ bookings. You can create a calculated attribute, then send the seed data to mParticle usingthe Calculated Attributes Seeding API. mParticle then combines your seed data and live data so thereâs no interruption.
You can seed calculated attributes in both draft (recommended) and active states; the calculated attribute must exist before you can seed it.
Seeding requires two pieces of information:
Note the following calculated attribute behavior:
Forwarding calculated attributes in an audience integration
If a partner supports user attribute forwarding, you can forward calculated attributes in an audience integration alongside user attributes. Different partners have implemented user attribute forwarding in different ways.
For example,Salesforceuses a separate data extension whileGoogle BigQueryuses the configuration setting Send User Attributes.
Use Case Guide
To walk through several different scenarios for using calculated attributes, download theCalculated Attributes Use Case Guide.

Using Calculated Attributes
Create, activate, and use calculated attributes from the mParticle user interface orPlatform API.
You can then view calculated attributes along with other user attributes in the UI or via the Profile API.
Step one: create a calculated attribute
Define the data used to run the calculation.
a. Select values from the drop-downs to define and add criteria as needed.
b. ClickNextto select a date range.
To choose the date range for your calculation, click on the Date Range drop-down:
SelectAll Timeto use all the data available per yourlong-term data retention policy. Therefore, selectingAll Timemay incur additional expenses due to larger data volumes.
You can seed the calculated attribute with historical data if you selectSinceorAll Timefor your date range. To seed, add the date you want to start using incoming mParticle dataâit can be a date different from the last date of seeded data. If you donât want to seed this calculated attribute, click the X on the right to remove it. For more information about seeding, seeSeed a calculated attribute.

Step two: activate a calculated attribute
A calculated attribute must be activated before mParticle starts calculating its values across your users.
To activate a calculated attribute:
When activated, mParticle computes and initializes the value for the calculated attribute.
Depending on the date range, volume of data in your workspace, and definition complexity, calculations require different amounts of time before they are available across your customer profiles. While calculating, the UI displays progress of the initialization.
Optional step: using the Calculated Attributes feed
You can use the default behavior for forwarding calculated attributes forwarding, or you can use
the special Calculated Attributes feed.
Forward calculated attributes in event batches (default behavior)
mParticle automatically enriches incoming batches with active calculated attributes for that user. Like regular user attributes, you can restrict which outputs receive them usingdata filters.

Forward calculated attributes in the Calculated Attributes Feed
The Calculated Attributes feed allows you to send calculated attributes downstream whenever they change, without an event from the user. This feed is especially useful for keeping calculated attributes with asynchronous calculations synchronized throughout your stack, and for sending calculated attributes downstream alongside kit integrations.
If your output partner supports the Calculated Attributes Feed, the input appears once you have activated a calculated attribute. When a new connection is made to this input, calculated attribute values for users who have not been seen since their asynchronous calculated attributes were calculated are sent. This feed sends an update when calculated attributes change (both synchronous & asynchronous); it does not send user attributes.
To control which downstream system receives these updates, connect specific platforms to receive the calculated attribute updates. You can also filter out calculated attributes you do not wish to forward using the platform filters page.

The calculated attributes feed is available with the following partners:
View calculated attributes in Live Stream, User Activity view, or Profile API
Calculated attributes can be viewed alongside other user attributes in theLive Streamand theUser Activity view, and are accessible via theProfile API.

Use calculated attributes in audiences
Use calculated attributes in the Audience builder by selectingUser > Calculated Attributes.
Calculated attributes appear as âstringâ types at first and then automatically switch to the correct type as they are computed across many users.  You can build audience criteria with a calculated attribute even if it is calculating. After the attribute values are completed for each user, their audience membership is updated.

Seed a calculated attribute
Seeding allows you to pass in historical values for calculated attributes that mParticle will build upon as new data arrives without passing in all the raw events. Seeding allows you to seamlessly transition from your own calculations to mParticleâs.
To use seeds with a calculated attribute:
Define a calculated attribute in the mParticle platform before sending any seeds.
The calculated attribute can be in either draft or active state. However, mParticle recommends the calculated attribute be activated after seeds for all users have been sent to mParticle. Once a calculated attribute is activated, mParticle starts calculating it, and thus some users may show inaccurate values until all seeds have been received.
Send seeds via theCalculated Attributes Seeding API.
Calculated attribute creation or update takes up to five minutes to be included in the mParticle cache. Therefore, if you send seeds immediately after creating or updating a calculated attribute, mParticle may send a NOT FOUND error.
Once mParticle has received seeds, mParticle combines them with calculated attribute results based on live data received after the cutoff date.
Calculated attribute changes and seeding
After seeds have been sent to mParticle, any of the following changes make the previously received seeds invalid and are deleted from mParticle.
Updating seeds
To update the seeds after you have sent them to mParticle, send the updated seeds to mParticle again. mParticle overwrites previously received seeds.
Historical data loads require recalculation
If you load historical data usingthe historical endpoint of the HTTP API, after loading, you must recreate new calculated attributes or update the definition of an existing CA to trigger a recalculation.

Create with AI Assistance
You can streamline the creation of Calculated Attributes by using natural language to specify the calculation you want the CA to represent. The criteria to generate your CA will then be auto-populated based on your description.
Enable AI assistance
On the Calculated Attributes landing page atEnrichment > Calculated Attributes, select theCalculated Attributesbutton in the top right. In theCreate Calculated Attributemodal, check theCreate with AI Assistanceoption. In theDescriptionfield, enter natural language that will be translated into a set of criteria for generating your Calculated Attribute.
Write a description for your Calculated Attribute
When writing your description, you should be as specific as possible about what you want your CA to do or represent. Use as many of the elements below that pertain to your use case:
For most calculations, youâll need to specify an event attribute in your description. The only exceptions are the following:
For all other calculation types, an event attribute is required.
Description Examples
Below are examples ofhigh-qualityandlow-qualitydescriptions for Calculated Attributes. High-quality descriptions include all necessary elements, while low-quality descriptions lack important details or contain errors that make it difficult for AI assistance to generate accurate criteria.

Calculated Attributes Reference
Use the following tables and lists to help you define each calculated attribute.
Calculations
The following table lists all supported calculations.
*Setting the date range toWithin the Lastcauses all calculations to be asynchronous.
Be aware of the following before creating your calculation attributes:
For aggregation CAs:
Calculation date range
The following date ranges in calculated attributes are supported:
Type conversions
Some calculated attributes, likesum, require numeric event attributes to function. If you select an attribute that is not detected as the correct type, the platform will warn you about using those fields in the calculated attribute definition. Youcan still usethe calculated attribute despite the warning, and it will attempt to convert the string values into numerics. For example, if you pass the attributeamountin as a numeric string like"34.32", asumcalculation will still work correctly: the string"34.32"will be converted to the decimal value34.32.

Conditions
When you define a calculated attribute, you can add conditional logic. For example, if you wanted to count the total number of times a promotion was clicked, but only for certain currencies, you could add the condition âwhere the currency code is only AUD or EUR.â
The following conditions are available for all four categories of calculated attributes (Count, Aggregation, Occurrence, and List):
Commerce quantity fields
The following behaviors affect commerce event attributes (commerce_events) in some calculated attributes:
Product events
The product action (product_action) and product impression (product_impression) attributes can be used in the quantity field for calculations. Note the following behaviors:
Promotion events
The promotion action (promotion_action) attribute can be used in the quantity field for calculations. Note the following behaviors:

Predictive Audiences Overview
You can build predictive audiences, which are goal-oriented, dynamic, and adaptive. By contrast, real-time and standard audiences are static and based on historical data.
Create a predictive audience by specifying a user prediction in your regular audience creation workflow in mParticle. The user prediction accesses Cortex machine learning algorithms that analyze data on customer behavior, preferences, and interactions with your brands. You can use predictive audiences to anticipate the needs and desires of your target audiences, and thus deliver more relevant and personalized messaging. Predictive audiences maximize impact by automatically finding the best-fit users for a desired outcome.
Example
In the past, you created a static (real-time) audience that identifies every user who has viewed shoes two or more times in the last week, and sent a coupon to all those users. However, now you can create a goal-oriented, predictive audience that contains all the users most likely to purchase shoes based on an analysis of all the available information, not just one factor (purchased shoes twice before).
Score and percentile values
When you create a predictive audience, you can choose between two types of results:
For example, if you wanted to know how likely it is that a user will purchase shoes in the next 7 days, you could see that likelihood displayed as a score or percentile:
How it works
Creating a predictive audience is simple:
For step-by-step instructions, seeUsing Predictive Audiences.
Predictions are rerun weekly to regenerate fresh predictions.
Limitations
Predictions created in mParticle have the following limitations:

Introduction
The mParticle platform is the hub for all of your data. It collects data from any number of inputs - mobile apps, web, feeds from external SAAS providers, data sent via our Events API - and forwards it on to output services to be used for analytics, attribution, storage, audience targeting, push notifications, etc.
The primary task accomplished in the mParticle dashboard is creating Connections between inputs and outputs - to collect your data, enrich and transform it, and forward it to where it needs to go. mParticle forwards two main types of data:
Accounts, organizations, and workspaces
mParticle creates a unique organization for you. Itâs the container for all data and metadata related to your mParticle. Within an organization, mParticle will create one or more accounts for you, and within each account, you can create one or more workspaces. Your choices for account and workspace setup are important because these choices affect identity and feature provisioning.

These three nested containers provide scoping and functionality for multi-brand and multi-geo use cases, as well as edge use cases. The scope and advantages of each are explained in the following sections.
Organization
Most mParticle customers have one organization which contains one or more accounts. However, some large companies have multiple organizations. No information is shared across organization boundaries. mParticle creates the organization(s) for you.
A few features apply at the organization level, includingprofile strategies.
You can think of the organization as representing your company.
Account
Each organization has one or more accounts. Accounts often represent different functional groups or goals within an organization, for example regional divisions, or Sales, Marketing, and Customer Support. mParticle creates the account(s) for you.
Some information is shared across accounts either by default or by enablement:
Workspace
Each account contains one or more workspaces. A workspace is the basic container for data in an mParticle account.  mParticle creates your first workspace, but you can add more at any time.
For most use cases, each workspace is its own domain, separate from other workspaces. Some information is shared across workspace boundaries:
Some mParticle accounts have over a dozen workspaces, while others have only one. How you organize data from your app ecosystem is entirely up to you.
Using organizations, accounts, and workspaces
Use organizations, accounts, and workspaces to manage multiple brands, regions, and to manage custom identity configurations and unique input/output requirements.  You can also use mParticle features likecross-account audience sharingormultiple workspace real-time audiences.
To see which accounts and organizations are available:
The Best Bags company sells handbags under several different names, and in several regions of the globe. They can use organizations and workspaces to provide differentiation when needed:
You can also useidentity scopeto manage how user data is shared between workspaces and accounts. And if you need to share audiences across accounts, you can request that mParticle enablecross-account audience sharingfor your organization.
Managing workspaces
Click on the name of your current workspace in the top-left corner of the dashboard to open the workspaces menu. From here you can switch into any of your current workspaces, or clickSettingsto open the Workspace Settings page.

From the Workspace Settings page, you can:
Note that you canât delete a workspace that is part of aMulti Workspace Audience. First delete or modify the multiworkspace audience, then you can delete the workspace.
Working with web data
mParticle handles Web data â collected from a browser client â a little differently from data collected from native apps.
In most cases, data collected by the mParticle SDK is sent to mParticle, and then forwarded on to integration partners server-to-server.
There are exceptions to this rule: in cases where a server-to-server integration cannot support all the required functionality of an integration partner, an Embedded Kit may be used. Embedded Kits are extra components added to the mParticle SDK that communicate directly with an integration partner from the app client.
While direct communication between the client and partner is the exception for native apps, it is common for web data. A key reason for this is that most of mParticleâs integration partners are not set up to receive web data server-to-server, as they rely on cookie data only accessible to the cookie owner. To support these integrations, the mParticle Web SDK uses the following workflow:
To make it easier to work with web integrations, we provide the source code in a public repository, so you can work with the Integration Partnerâs documentation and see exactly how we map mParticle methods onto the Partner code. See themparticle-integrations organizationfor a complete list of client-side web integrations.
Platform limits
mParticle imposes limits on the number and length of attributes that can be associated with events and users.
A quick summary of some of the most important limits is below. For more information, see our fullDefault Service Limitsguide.
Events
Users
Note that Output Services often have their own limits, which can differ from mParticleâs. When planning your implementation, check the documentation for your Output Services in theIntegration Centerto make sure you are complying with their limits.
Tracking protection
Browsers add third-party tracking protection for end users. The protections affect third-party trackers and their cookies and work in different ways. For example, Firefox Enhanced Tracking Protection (ETP) relies on a list of known trackers to decide what to block. Safari, Chrome for iOS and other browsers with the Apple WebKit engine use Intelligent Tracking Protection (ITP). ITP prevents the browser from loading cookies from a third-party domain.
mParticle aligns with this privacy stance.
User attributes and event attributes
mParticle ingests data points that are composed of event attributes and user attributes.
User attributes and input source priority
For a given user, attributes are stord at the workspace level, not the device level.
User attributes are ingested according to the following priority:
Once ingested from a particular source type, subsequent source types for that same data wonât be ingested. For example, once you set a user attribute key value using the Web SDK, you wonât be able to set that same value from a partner data feed.
Timestamps and ingested data
When mParticle ingests data, there are two timestamps associated with events:
If batches or events have a timestamp that is more than 15 minutes in the future, relative to the server processing the data, that timestamp will be reset to the current server UTC time. Attribute timestamps remain unchanged.
If you load data using CSV Import, the batch timestamp is reset to the current server UTC time.
Forward-looking statements
mParticle strives to be as transparent as possible. Part of this transparency is to share information about products, features, or functionality that we expect to deliver in the future.
Forward-looking statements are as accurate as possible given the knowledge at the time of publication. However, no purchasing decisions should be made on the basis of any forward-looking statement, and mParticle may withdraw or change the products, features, or functionality mentioned in such statements.
Next steps
To get started with mParticle, set up some data inputs and integrate with at least one output service. SeeWeb End-to-End Tutorialfor instructions on how to set up connections, and see your first data flow from input to output. If you arenât working with Web apps or services, visitGetting Startedfor more generic instructions.
Once youâre up and running, see the rest of this Platform guide for a more advanced look at the mParticle dashboard, or browseIntegrationsto see all available integrations.

Using Predictive Audiences
You can create predictive audiences in the mParticle UI.
Note that you may see the name âVidoraâ instead of Cortex in some documentation and UI screens.
Prerequisites
Create a predictive audience
To create and activate a predictive audience:
If you havenât already created a user prediction, click User Prediction from the list and enter the User Prediction information:
If youâve already created a user prediction, select it from the list inUsers > Choose User Feature > User Attributes.
After you create a prediction, a pipeline is created in Cortex, and the pipeline begins calculating. Calculation may take up to 24 hours, though typically the delay is about an hour.
If thereâs not enough data to learn from, the calculation may fail and the prediction wonât exist, resulting in an empty audience. To correct this, choose different criteria or troubleshoot your data for issues.
To check on the status of your pipeline, view it in Cortex.
Include and exclude users from predictions
When setting criteria for a new user prediction, you can specify whether Cortex should generate that prediction for all users or a specific subset. Narrowing predictions to a subset of users can help improve the accuracy of your predictions, and avoid generating predictive attributes for users who are not relevant to a specific use case.
To focus on a subset of users, select the optionA subset of usersin theMake predictions forfield.

Once youâve selected this option, you can build queries with user attributes and behavioral events to select the users for whom Cortex will generate this prediction.

Why include or exclude users?
While it may be counterintuitive, using more data to generate a prediction does not mean the prediction will be more accurate. Not all users are relevant to every prediction you want to create, and irrelevant users can make it more difficult for the ML model to identify meaningful patterns and trends. This is why itâs best to consider the business outcome you want to achieve when defining the user segment that will generate a prediction.
Use case examples
Objective:Non-subscriber to subscriber conversion
Objective:Subscription upgrade (tier 1 to tier 2)
Objective:Churn prevention
Objective:Cross sell: Get purchasers of item A to buy a variant at a higher price point
Objective:Predicting which viewers who have not yet watched a show will watch it in the future

Journeys Overview
Use Journeys to move away from simple cross-channel engagement toward an organization-wide customer journey strategy. Journeys help you to perform journey analysis, testing, and orchestration in a single workflow:
Because customers interact with your brand in many different ways at many different times, you need to reach them based on their behaviors, and reach them with a cohesive voice to deliver a personalized experience across multiple marketing channels.
You want to design a multistep journey: starting with the users available with the inputs you select, you can apply sets of criteria called milestones. At each milestone a new audience is created, which you can then send downstream for further action.
You can create as many journeys as you need (up to your active audience limit), and delete empty journeys when they are no longer useful. You can also delete milestones and their related audiences and connections from a journey and add new milestones.
Journey workflow
At the start of the journey, you have access to all the users available from all the inputs from all the workspaces in your account. You choose the workspaces and inputs you wish to select audience members from, and then build the journey:
The following diagram shows a simple journey with two milestones:
In this journey, all customers who engage with the app are sent an email, and those who open the email are sent a mobile push notification.
Notice the following:
Journey path splits
Each step in the customer journey can be split into additional paths. For example, you could define a set of milestones for customers who buy handbags, shoes, or winter coats. Each milestone becomes the start of a new path.
You can also create a milestone for all audience members that havenât fit any previous milestone criteria. This split is called a remaining user split.
Split behaviors
Examples
The following three examples show the different ways you can use multiple splits.
Use predictions to reduce churn and vary customer communications
Powered by Cortex, customer-centric teams can predict a userâs likelihood to churn. Using that prediction, teams can deliver a unique set of experiences for users who have a high likelihood to churn.

In this example, a brand engages high-churn risk users on multiple channels to ensure they get the message. In addition, the brand sets up a fail safe for the users who received an email but didnât open it, engaging them over SMS.
Engage customers in the right channel based on customer consent
One key piece of user preference is their consent status, what theyâve told the brand about how they want their data to be used for marketing purposes.

In this example, an eCommerce retailer delivers two different kinds of experiences based on a userâs consent to GDPR.
If users have consented, the retailer sends a mobile notification as a reminder to convert. For the remaining users, those who have not consented, the retailer triggers an in-app coupon if the user returns after several days.
Trigger post-purchase sequences based on a customerâs lifetime value
For many retailers, a userâs purchase of a product is just the beginning of the relationship between the customer and the brand. After a purchase, the retailer can suggest to the customer many possible next steps to prolong and deepen that relationship: purchasing more products, leaving a review, referring a friend, posting on social media, and more.

In this example, retailers trigger the next best step based on a userâs lifetime value.  For high LTV customers, brands can assume that theyâre fans of the brand, and would be more willing to refer a friend. If the retailer knows a loyal customerâs preferred engagement channel, they can communicates with them there. For the remaining users, those who are not high LTV customers, a retailer can recommend products that pair well with the one that a customer just purchased.
Audience estimator
Each audience that you create in a journey provides an estimated audience size immediately, so that you donât have to wait for the audience calculation to complete. Once an audience has at least one active connection, audiences and all parent audiences in same path begin calculating the real size. When an audience begins calculating it no longer shows the estimated size.

To estimate the audience size quickly, mParticle samples the total number of users.
You see the estimated size of the audience with all criteria applied (as shown in the previous image). Estimated audience size per criteria is also displayed on the milestone.
Use the audience estimatorâs immediate feedback to adjust criteria definitions and parameters if needed:
In some cases, you may see different symbols instead of an estimated size:
Journeys and billing
When an audience is actively connected, that audience is activated and consumes a real-time audience credit. Unlike the real-time audience experience, there is no explicit audience status of Draft or Active. The status is now derived from the connection status.
To view the number of audiences available to you, in mParticle go toAudiences > Journeysto display the list of journeys. The number of activated and available audiences is displayed under the New Journey button:

Manage Journeys
Create, modify, or delete journeys to manage your customer journey strategy.
Before you start
Prepare to create a journey:
Verify that you can create the number of activated audiences you plan to create in your journey. In mParticle, visitAudiences > Real-timeto see how many activated audiences are available:
Step 1. Create a journey
To create a journey:
ClickSave. The canvas displays the milestone you just created and the audience for that milestone.
You can connect to an output now or wait until youâve created all the milestones. SeeConfigure connectionsfor details.
You can either define the next step in the existing path by clicking the plus sign, or split the path by clicking the split icon, and create one or more additional milestones:
You canât modify the criteria for a remaining user milestone.
Step 2. Configure connections
For each milestone:
In the audience for the milestone, clickConnect Outputto select an output for the audience you just created. For more information about output connections, seeConnections. You can add one or more outputs to each audience. You can leave the audience inactive until you are ready to activate it, which starts sending audience members to the output.
To change a connection status after you have created a milestone, click the down-arrow across from the connection name, then click the status badge to open the Connection Settings dialog, and click the button to activate or deactivate a connection.
After a connection is activated, all parent audiences in the path are set to âCalculating.â Audience size estimates are updated to the actual audience size.
After youâve added all the milestones and connected and activated all the outputs, youâve fully defined the journey.
Deactivate an output
If you wish to stop sending audience updates to one of the connections in a journey, you must either deactivate or delete the connection for that audience.
To deactivate an output, click on the output name in the audience box, and then click theActivebadge to display the Connections Settings dialog where you can set the output toInactive.
Delete a journey
To delete a journey:

Download an audience from a journey
You can download an active, calculated audience as a CSV file. This is useful if you want to troubleshoot your audience criteria, or if you want to share your audience data with a partner without an official mParticle Audience integration.
Audience downloads take some time to prepare depending on the volume of users in the audience, ranging from a few minutes up to ~6 hours for extremely large audiences.
Audience downloads are available on Real-time audiences only. To download a Standard Audience, connect and send it to an infrastructure output, like Amazon S3 via a Kinesis connection, and download it from there.
Step 1. Initiate a download
To download an audience from the the journey where it is defined:
From the journey where you have defined an audience, click the three dot icon in the active audience that you wish to download.

If the audience includes A/B Testing Variants, you can select which variants you want to download.
Determine whether you want to download the full audience or an audience sample. Downloading a sample will likely take less time than downloading a full audience (depending on the audience size), and is useful for testing or troubleshooting.

Select the identity types you want, then clickDownload.

Step 2. Download the file
The download takes some time to prepare. When your download is ready, mParticle sends you an email with the download link.
The download is a ZIP file which, when extracted, will contain a CSV file for each audience or variant, plus amanifest.jsonfile, with metadata about the files.
CSV format
Audience CSV files have a row for each identity in the audience. Remember that a single user profile can have multiple identities and, therefore, multiple rows.
The four columns show a Unix timestamp when the audience membership was retrieved for download, the mParticle ID of the profile, the identity type, and the value:
The manifest file is in JSON format.

Audience A/B testing from a journey
Audience A/B Testing allows you to split an audience into two or more variations and create connections for each variation independently, to help you to compare the performance of different targeting approaches. For example, if you have an audience of low engagement users that you want to reengage with your app, you might devise a test like this:
You can then compare the engagement outcomes for each group and apply the most successful strategy to the entire audience.
Create a journey


After saving your variations, you will see each variation in a new branch within the Journey Builder.

Create a connection
After defining your variations, you can connect each one, including the control group, to any output by clicking+ Connect Output. There is also an option to connect the full audience to an output by clicking+ Connect Outputon the original audience card prior to the A/B split.
In theAudiencessummary screen, audiences with an active A/B test will be marked with a%symbol.

Note that whenever the Audience Name is used in forwarding the audience to downstream partners, variant audiences will be named using the format[Audience External Name] - [Variant Name].
Change an audience definition
You can edit an audience definition without affecting the audience split, even after connecting to an output. When the audience is updated, the variants will still be balanced as defined when you created the test.
You cannot modify the percentages of an A/B test after creating the test.
